Summary:

An interface between Finite Element (F.E.) preprocessing and F.E. analysis program is defined. The interface is defined as a file where all data are stored according to a unified file format. This standardisation is performed in order to enable different F.E. preprocessors to be coupled to the same application
program, or vice versa.
To obtain computer portability of generated F.E. model data, the interface file is defined as a sequential
character file with a fixed record length. An application program may read the interface file by applying a standard formatted FORTRAN read statement. The contents may be displayed and edited by applying an operating system text editor.
The data are divided into groups that naturally belong together.
The interface file is prepared for the superelement technique.

INTRODUCTION

This manual contains a description of the input part of the SESAM Interface File, the Input Interface File. The
results part of the SESAM Interface File, is described in a separate manual, "SESAM Results Interface File
Description" /1/.
The large amount of input data common to many different finite element (F.E.) program systems has been one
of the main reasons for developing general F.E. preprocessors. These general preprocessors, separated from
the F.E. application programs, give the user a unified way of defining input data applicable to different program systems.
A separated general F.E. preprocessor offers some important advantages. The data preparation phase can now
be performed interactively on a local mini computer, while the real analysis can be executed in batch. Further,
the user will be able to apply different F.E. systems without having to spend costly time learning the input of
the various systems.
One problem, however, is how to interface the preprocessor to the F.E. programs.
General requirements to this interface are:
1

Analysis portability
The data produced by the preprocessor must be easily applicable to different analysis programs

2

Computer portability
The F.E. analysis programs, applying input from the preprocessor, may run on different types of computers.

3

Extensibility
The interface must be able to handle new data types as the preprocessor is interfaced to new application
areas, (e.g. different types of non-linear analysis).

4

Flexibility
The interface should have the ability to transfer all types of non-standard input data, (e.g. input data typical for only one particular application program.

INTERFACE FILE FORMAT
Record Format

To meet the requirements of portability, extensibility and flexibility, an interface has been chosen where the
data are stored on a simple sequential, record file, similar to the input of the early F.E. programs.
Each record1 of this file has a fixed length of 72 characters. Furthermore, each record is subdivided into five
fields, one 8 character identifier field and four 16 character data fields. The identifier gives information concerning the type of data stored, like nodal geometry, constraints, etc. Data types consisting of more than four
items, will have the remaining items described in the succeeding records (four in each), all with a blank record
identifier.
The notation data record is used for the data string starting with a non-blank identifier to the next non-blank
identifier. A 72 character record as described above is denoted file record. A data record may consist of several file records.
This record file will be made readable by standard FORTRAN I/O. The data generated will then be simple to
use by the application programs.
When data are transferred between computers of different makes, all system-generated information (if any)
must be removed. The format of the interface file will have the following characteristics:
1

A sequential character file

2

A fixed record length of 72 characters

3

A standard ASCII character code (when formatted FORTRAN format of the file is chosen).

4

Records with all the same format, i.e. one 8-character identifier field (2A4) and four 16-character data
fields (4E16.8). Except text fields which have (18A4).

On each installation the interface file is supported by simple read-and-write routines which will convert the

data to a format readable by the system editor employing a formatted file, which is the default.. However, to
save computing and I/O-time there is an option to write the file unformatted. Then the file is not transferable
between different computers.
The sequence of data records is arbitrary within each data type, with some exceptions registered below in the
description of the data types. The sequence of data types is arbitrary.

2.2

File Naming Conventions

The records are assembled in one file per superelement. The file name will be determined by following naming convention (where nnnn is the superelement no. and xxx identifies the model):
1

VAX (VMS) - computers
[directory]xxxTnnnn.FEM

2

IBM370 series (MVS).
prefix.FEM(Tnnn)
See also separate User’s Guide for IBM - OS / MVS

3

IBM370 series (VM).
FEMTnn prefix filemode
See also separate User’s Guide for IBM - VM.

4

UNIX
Tnnnn.FEM

5

ND (SINTRAN) - computers
(user)xxxTnnnn:FEM
See also ND User’s Guide

A special feature is possible if the interface files are formatted. They may then be appended to one file. Refer
to IEND record on page 4-3.

The following restrictions are put on the data types
GELINT

The integration stations must be distributed according to the Gaussian integration scheme,
i.e. INTYPE=1. For this element type the GELINT specifications consist of the first two
lines.
Stiffness matrix: For stiffness matrix calculations the number of integration stations will be
the same in all coordinate directions and equal to the value specified for N1.
Legal values are 2, 3 and 4.
For a regular element N1 = 2 may cause a singular stiffness matrix.
Default value is 3.
Load calculations: Here, the number of integration stations in each coordinate direction must
be specified individually. If volume forces are calculated, legal values for N1, N2 and N3 are
2, 3 and 4.
For surface forces, the legal value for N1, N2 and N3 is 2.
Default value is 2.
Initial strain: The number of integration stations in each coordinate direction must be specified individually.
Legal values for N1, N2 and N3 are 2, 3 and 4.
Default value is 2.
Mass matrix: Again the number of integration stations in each direction must be specified individually.
Legal values for N1, N2 and N3 are 3 and 4.
Default value is 3.

GELSTRP

The stress points must be distributed according to the Gaussian integration scheme, i.e.
STRPTYP=1. Only the first two records of the GELSTRP specification are therefore used in

INTNO and ISPONO are not read because number of integration and stress points are
constant in the program and can not be set by user.
No thickness variation is allowed for this element. If thickness variation is specifed by
the GEONO / OPT option, the finite element program executing this element must use a
mean thickness calculated from the nodal thicknesses.

BEUSLO

This element type is only able to calculate surface loads which are acting perpendicular to the
element surface. Hence LOTYP=1 (normal pressure) should be used. If LOTYP=2 (loads
given in component form) are specified, the in-plane components are ignored by the program.
Surface loads are always referred to the middle plane of these elements, i.e. SIDE=2 (nead

The integration stations must be distributed according to a scheme similar to the Gaussian
integration scheme, i.e. INTYPE=1. For this element type the GELINT specifications consist
of the first line only. The integration stations will be specified in the triangle plane, and not
along local coordinate axes. The value specified for N1 is not the number of integration stations but a reference number to specified distributions of integration stations, which may
have the same number of integration stations, but different positions in the triangle plane.
Therefore, N3 has no meaning for this element type. Legal values for N1 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

ζ-direction will be performed analytically if max deviation from mean thickness is 5% and
the element is nearly flat.
Stiffness matrix: Default value for N1 is 7.
Load calculations: Default value for N1 is 6 for surface loads.
Initial strain: Default value for N1 is 6.
Mass matrix: N1 should be specified ³ 7 to ensure positive definite mass matrix. Default
value is N1=7.

GELSTRP

The stress points must be distributed according to the same scheme as the integration points
in the GELINT specification, for stress point coordinates in the triangular plane. The stress
point coordinates in the ζ-direction are distributed according to the usual Gaussian integration scheme STRPTYP=1. Legal values for N1 are 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and for N2 2, 3, 4.
Default values for N1 is 3 and for N2 the default value is 2.

lines. For the triangle plane the integration stations will be distributed according to the usual
Gaussian integration scheme. N1 will be employed for the specification of number of integration stations in the triangular plane; N2 for the number of integration stations in the ζdirection. N3 will be employed for the specification of number of integration stations in the
direction perpendicular to the ζ-direction in the four edged surfaces, used in the calculation
of surfaces, used in the calculation of surface loads.
Stiffness matrix: Legal values for N1 are 3, 4 and 7, and for N2 legal values are 2, 3 and 4.
Default values are N1=7 and N2=3. N3 is not used in this case.
Load calculations: For surface loads N3 will be employed as described above. Legal values

The following restrictions are put on data type:
GELINT

The integration stations must be distributed according to the Gaussian integration sceme, i.e.
INTYPE=1. For this element type the GELINT specifications consist of only the first line.
For the triangular plane the integration stations will be specified in the plane and not along
local coordinate axis. In the z-direction, integration stations will be distributed according to
the usual Gaussian integration shceme. N1 will be used for specification of number of integration points in the triangular plane, N2 for the number of integration stations in the zdirection.
Stiffness matrix calculation: Legal values for N1 are 3, 4 and 7, for N2, 2, 3 and 4. Default
values are N1=4 and N2=3.
Load calculation: For surface loads N1 will not be used. Number of integration stations in
z-direction is given by N2 as before. Legal values of N2 are 2, 3 and 4, with 3 as default.
Number of integration stations normal to the z-direction is set equal to one less than N2.
This gives a default value equal to 2, and with legal values 1, 2 and 3.
Initial strain: Legal values for N1 are 3, 4 and 7, and for N2, 2, 3 and 4. Default values are
N1=4 and N2=3.
Mass matrix calculations: The only legal values for N1 and N2 are N1=4 and N2=3.

The following restrictions are put on data type:
GELINT

Only the default values for number of integration points are used. This means that if GELINT is given, N1 must be specified equal to the default value for the calculation type in
question:
Stiffness matrix: The centroid of the element is used as the only calculation point.
Load calculation: Constant volume force is only calculated in the centroid of the element.
Surface forces in arbitrary direction are calculated in three points on the loaded side, and constant normal pressure is calculated in the midpoint on the loaded side.
Initial strain: The centroid of the element is used as the only calculation point.
Mass matrix: Four integration points are used. These are distributed according to the Gaussian integration scheme.

GELSTRIP

Stresses are only calculated in the centroid of the element. If the GELSTRP specification is
given, only the first record is used. This must be given with STRPTYP=1 and N1=1. N2
should not be specified.

BEUSLO

Only one side can be loaded in each load case. This means that only one side identification
can be given in SIDE. The element can only reproduce a constant strain situation. Variation
in loads will cause a stress situation which the element is not able to reproduce. Therefore
this element should only be used for constant loads, i.e. the load intensity should be the same
for all the nodes on the loaded side.

BELLO2

The SIDE definition is not used. The load components are given nodewise in global coordinates.

along local coordinate axes. The value specified for N1 is not the number of integration stations but a reference number to specified distributions of integration stations, which may
have the same number of integration stations, but different positions in the triangle planes.
Therefore, N3 has no meaning for this element type. Legal values for N1 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, see description of subroutine HAMC30 in the finite element library, /2/. N2 ("ζdirection") is not possible to specify and the value 2 is used for each layer. The integration in
ζ-direction will be performed analytically if max deviation from mean thickness is 5% and
the element is nearly flat.
Stiffness matrix: Default value for N1 is 7.
Load calculations: Default value for N1 is 6 for surface loads.
Initial strain: Default value for N1 is 6.
Mass matrix: N1 should be specified ³ 7 to ensure positive definite mass matrix. Default
value is N1=7.

GELSTRP

The stress points must be distributed according to the same scheme as the integration points
in the GELINT specification, for stress point coordinates in the triangular plane. The stress
point coordinates in the ζ-direction are distributed according to the usual Gaussian integration scheme STRPTYP=1. Legal values for N1 are 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and for N2 2, 3, 4.
Default values for N1 is 3 and for N2 ("z-direction") the default value is 2.

Loads on the element are specified as if given for an IHEX element (ELTYP=20) (the so-called originating
IHEX element) with that element’s number of nodes, type of nodes (3 translational degrees of freedom) and
sequence of nodes specifying the originating element. (see the tables and figures below for TRSI(36), TRSI(37)
and TRSI(38)).
When surface load is specified for one element side, the load intensities are always given in eigth points on
each side, regardless of this beeing a "solid side" or a "shell side". These points are the nodes on the "solid
sides", and the points on the upper and lower element side corresponding to the nodes on the "shell sides". The
points on the upper and lower shell element side is marked with the same number as the node in the ’shell
middle plane’ with a ’ (prime) and " (double prime) to separate them from the ’real nodes’.

With correspondence to Figure 5-41, 5-42 and 5-43 the local node ("point") numbering of each side is defined
as follows:

It should be noted that the points in the three tables and Figs. 5-41, 5-42 and 5-43 below are in the same topological positions on the sides, but the node (point) numbers are different, since number of ’real nodes’ are different. The point numbers are sort of dummy numbers and only used to indicate the sequence of the load intensities to be specified.

Restrictions on modelling with transition elements:
The "shell type nodes" have no stiffness connected to the rotational degree of freedom perpendicular to the
middle plane. In shell elements this is taken care of by inserting a small stiffness value to avoid a rectangular
system. Hence the "shell type nodes" of the transition elements must always be coupled to a shell element in
order to avoid a singular stiffness matrix.

groups were the data are specified as if given for an IHEX element (ELTYP=20). The element thickness of the shell type node(s) must be referred to, either directly by GEONO/OPT
or indirectly by GEONO(i) (with GEONO/OPT=-1). In the latter case the GEONO(i) for
solid type numbers are of no consequence (set equal to zero).
The data is as if given for an IHEX element (ELTYP=20). When giving nodal values
(intensities) they shall refer to a so-called originating IHEX element. See Figure 5-41
above.

As General Spring it is just a 2-noded spring (12x12 matrix) which may be in a local coordinate system. As a
shim element the preprocessor(s) will only insert stiffness in the local x- and y-direction. In the analysis program(s), shim members and general springs are treated exactly in the same manner.
The resulting spring matrix is a full symmetric matrix where all values on and below the main diagonal are
stored.

Typical general hexahedron

When surface loads are specified for the element side, the surface numbers shown are used for identification of
the side in question. The node numbers 21 to 27 signifies the node position number. The actual node number
within the actual element is 20 + number of nodes up to node position which are present in the actual element.
Which node number shall actually be used in the tables below may be determined by the table of nodes in node
position above. If the node position in question is empty the number of nodes on the line or side is one less, and
compacted when the line is missing one node.
The local node numbering for each side is defined as follows:

The imaginary part of the global intensity with respect to the last degree of freedom with load

The legal degrees of freedom are the translational components, given in the global coordinate system.
The imaginary numbers follow immediately after the real numbers, i.e. there are no blank fields between the
last real part and the first imaginary part.
For the two noded beam element BEAS, the line of action of the load will be the axes through the shear center.
In order to clearify the meaning of EDOF, imagine a beam element with three nodal points. If translatory loads
are applied in the global y- and z-direction, the last degree of freedom to have load specified is the third degree
of freedom. EDOF will therefore in this case be 3 x 3 = 9. The load intensity for the x-direction will be included, but with the value zero of course.
If the line of application of the line load does not match the node positioning along the beam, the following
example will hopefully explain how this problem is solved on the interface file. Node1 (see Figure 6-2) will
have the intensity zero, whereas node2 will have the intensity corresponding to the correct intensity at the starting point of the line load. The real point of application (used in the integration process) of course is governed
by L1.

when LOTYP = 3, RLOAD must be +1.0.
If phase shift is not specified, i.e. COMPLX = 0, the fields or positions ILOAD1, ILOAD2, etc. are left out.
Normal pressure means that only one pressure component is specified for each node, and this pressure component is acting normal to the surface.
For volume elements a positive value means normal pressure directed into the element. For shell elements, a
positive value means normal pressure in the local z-direction.

and NW = 2*NDOF if complex loads
All other record types on the interface file are written with 6 words on each record, where the
first two words are reserved for the character string identifier. These positions are blank on
the second and following images, until the beginning of a new record is reached.
The data type BNWALO is only generated by WAJAC and may only be read by SESTRA. The data type
should not be used for new applications.

an assembly of integration points over a cross section of a 1-dimensional (beam or a bar) element,

•

an assembly of integration points on a line through the thickness of a two-dimensional element,

•

one single integration point for a three-dimensional element.

Number of integration points in each direction. See also explanation of INTYPE above. For
the 3-dimensional 20 noded hexahedron elements the values may be 2, 3, 4, 32 or 42. A two
digit number means that different number of integration points are used for normal strain
stiffness terms, and shear stiffness terms to avoid ’shear locking’.

For a uniform separation with DISTANCE0 not specified, it will for a stiffener layer result in a smearing (multiplication) factor (Fs) in the stiffener direction for Young’s modulus (E1). This factor is relative to a plate
layer with the same heigth as the stiffener layer.
Fs = b / d1
where:
b = width of each stiffener

RULES FOR EXTENSION OF THE INTERFACE

The interface may easily be extended to include new application areas, or simply to include data which have
been left out. Some rules must, however, be followed in order to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. The
rules can be summarized as:
a)

Data on one record must belong to only one group, i.e. one of the eight groups defined in
Section 3.

b)

No identifier already employed must be used to identify data of different meaning.

c)

The first character of each identifier must have the appropriate letter already defined in Section 3.

d)

The maximum number of characters of each identifier is eight.

e)

Alphanumeric characters (ASKII) may be employed to describe an identifier.

f)

Otherwise identical identifiers for first and higher levels may be separated with a numeric
character at the end of the identifier, i.e. 1 for first level and 2 for higher levels.

g)

Identifiers should preferably be chosen which can easily be related to the type of data which
are stored.

h)

Each file record is fixed consisting of 72 characters, i.e. an eight character identifier field and
four data fields compatible with the FORTRAN 4E16.8 format.

i)

Text strings may follow TEXT identifiers. Text data have a separate format (A72). See description of the TEXT record.

surface loads (BEUSLO records) at the end in loadcase 1,2 and 3 and gravitational load in the global Xdirection in loadcase 4 (BGRAV record).
After modelling the beam in PREFEM, the internal node numbering has been redone to optimize the bandwidth
with the program BPOPT. The internal node numbers in the interface file X11DAT1.FEM is after bandwidth
optimization.
The rest of the information needed to carry out these analyses is given as direct command input to SESTRA
(see ref. /11/ ).

STATICAL ANALYSIS OF A JACKET MODELLED BY REPEATED SUPERELEMENTS.

The geometry and loads on the jacket is shown in Figure A-3.
The jacket is assemled of two-noded beams only. The model is based on two first level superelements (types 11
and 12) illustrated in Figure A-4. The corresponding interface files created by use of PREFRAME are named
X3AT11.FEM and X3AT12.FEM.
The first level superelement type 11 is repeated four times by use of PRESEL, giving the second level superelement type 21 as shown in Figure A-5. Similarily, two first level elements type 12 (one mirrored) are assembled in superelement type 22 on second level.
Further, the two second level superelements are assembled in the third level superelement type 31, shown in
Figure A-6.
In this example also a fourth level superelement type 41 is used, see superelement hierarchy in Figure A-7.
This is because this example is based on test example 3 in Ref. /10/, where also piles are included in the model,
and this requires the coordinate system to be turned, see comment in Figure A-7.
Note that load case number 5 (LC5 in Figure A-3) in the test example is generated by the wave loading program WAJAC, and is therefore not included in the first level interface files given below. Two load interface
files X3AL11.FEM and X3AL12.FEM are made by WAJAC, but they are not included here.
