The nastran Command
MSC.Nastran is executed with a command called nastran. (Your system manager may
assign a different name to the command.) The nastran command permits the
specification of keywords used to request options affecting MSC.Nastran job
execution. The format of the nastran command is:
nastran input_data_file [keyword1 = value1

keyword2 = value2 ...]

where input_data_file is the name of the file containing the input data and
keywordi=valuei is one or more optional keyword assignment arguments. For
example, to run an a job using the data file example1.dat, enter the following
command:
nastran example1

Keyword assignments can be specified as command line arguments and/or included
in RC files.

There are two RC files controlled by you:

• The user RC file is in your home (or login) directory. This file should be used
to define parameters that are applied to all jobs run by you.

• The local RC file is .nast705rc, in the same directory as the input data file. If
the “rcf” keyword is used, this local RC file is ignored. This file should be
used to define parameters that are applied to all jobs contained in the input
data file directory.
1. The tilde (~) character is not recognized within RC files.
2. Environment variables are only recognized when used in the context of a
logical symbol (see “Using Filenames and Logical Symbols” on page 101 of
the MSC.Nastran 2004 Installation and Operations Guide).
3. When a keyword is specified on the command line, embedded spaces or
special characters that are significant to the shell must be properly quoted;
quotes should not be used within RC files.
The keywords listed below are the most common for various computers, but are not
available on all computers. Also, the defaults may be site dependent. Please consult
your “Keywords and Environment Variables” on page 281 of the MSC.Nastran 2004
Installation and Operations Guide for keyword applicability, specialized keywords, and
further discussion of the keywords and their defaults. Keywords that use yes/no

3

values accept partial specification and case-independent values. For example, “yes”
may be specified as “y”, “ye”, or “yes” using uppercase or lowercase letters. The
examples assume the jobs are run under a UNIX operating system.

1
nastran

after

after=time

Default: None

Holds the job until the time specified by time. See the description of the
“at” command in your system documentation for the format of time.
Example:

nastran example after=10:00

2
FMS

The job is held until 10:00 AM.
append

append={yes|no}

Default: no

Combines the F04, F06, and LOG files into a single file after the run
completes. If “no” is specified, the files are not combined. If “yes” is
specified, the files are combined into one file with the suffix “.out”.
Example:

nastran example append=yes

The F04, F06, and LOG files are combined into a file named example.out.
batch

batch={yes|no}

Default: yes

Indicates how the job is to be run. If “yes” is specified, the job is run as a
background process. If “no” is specified, the job is run in the foreground.
If the “aft” or “queue” keywords are specified the batch keyword is
ignored.
Note: If the job is already running in an NQS or NQE batch job, the default
is “no”.

output files using sequence numbers. Sequence numbers are appended
to the keyword filename and are separated by a period.

4A
4B

If “yes” is specified, the highest sequence number of each of the output
files is determined. The highest sequence number found is incremented
by one to become the new sequence number. Then, all current output
files that do not include sequence numbers are renamed using the new
sequence number as a suffix.

v2401.log
v2401.log.1
v2401.log.2
v2401.log.3
v2401.f06.1

Apparently, the user ran the job four times, but deleted some of the files.
When the next job is run, the following files are renamed: v2401.f04 is
renamed to v2401.f04.4, v2401.f06 is renamed to v2401.f06.4, and
v2401.log is renamed to v2401.log.4. The sequence number 4 is used
because it is one greater than the highest sequence number of all of the
selected files (the highest being v2401.log.3). Using this method, all files
related to a single run will have the same sequence number.

7

out

out=pathname

Default=input_data_file directory.

Saves the output files using a different file prefix or in a different
directory. If “out” is not specified, the output files are saved in the current
directory using the base name of the input data file as a prefix.
If the “out” value is a directory, output files are created in the specified
directory using the base name of the input data file as the filename. In the
following examples, assume the following directory contents and the job
is running in a UNIX operating system:
example.data mydir/ other/
other/example.dat
where “mydir” and “other” are directories.
Example:

nastran example

or:

nastran other/example

Output files are created in the current directory with name example, e.g.,
./example.f06.
Example:

nastran example out=myfile

Output files are created in the current directory with name myfile, e.g.,
./myfile.f06.
Example:

nastran example out=mydir/myfile

Output files are created in the mydir directory with name myfile, e.g.,
mydir/myfile.f06.
prt

scratch

$ nastran example rcf=nast.rc

scratch={yes|no|mini} Default=no
Deletes the database files at the end of the run. If the database files are not
required, “scratch=yes” can be used to remove them; preventing
cluttering of the directory with unwanted files. If “mini” is specified, a
reduced size database (that can only be used for data recovery restarts)
will be created. See “Database Concepts” on page 513 of the
MSC.Nastran Reference Guide for further details on the “mini” database.

X-Y PLOT

Specifies the directory to use for temporary scratch files created during
the run. MSC.Nastran can create very large scratch files, the scratch
directory should contain sufficient space to store any scratch files created
during a run. You must have read, write, and execute privileges to the
directory.

5
PARAM

The default value is taken from the TMPDIR environment variable if it is
set to a nonnull value. Otherwise the computer’s default temporary file
directory is chosen; this is usually /tmp, but on Silicon Graphics systems,
it is /var/tmp.

Note: This keyword is overridden by the FMS statement ASSIGN
SCRATCH(MEM=value).
Example:

nastran example smem=200

1
nastran

This example reserves 200 GINO blocks for scratch memory.
symbol

symbol=symbolic_name= Default: None
string
Defines a symbolic (or logical) name used on ASSIGN and INCLUDE
statements and in command line arguments. This statement can only be
specified in initialization or RC files. It cannot be specified on the
command line (although logical symbols defined using this keyword
may be used on the command line). Symbolic names must be 16
characters or less, the value assigned to the symbolic name must be 256
characters or less. If the symbolic name used in ASSIGN or INCLUDE
statements or in command line arguments is not defined, it is left in the
filename specification as is.
For example, many of the TPL and DEMO input data files have ASSIGN
statements, such as the following:
ASSIGN

MASTER=DBSDIR:abc.master

The string “DBSDIR:” specifies a symbolic name that is to be replaced by
another string. The replaced string is defined by the “symbol” keyword
in the initialization or RC file or as an environment variable. For example,
SYMBOL=DBSDIR=/dbs

5
PARAM

When the previous ASSIGN statement is processed, the filename
assigned to the logical name MASTER is “/dbs/abc.master”. An
alternate way of defining symbolic names is through the use of
environment variables. For example, issuing the following command at a
Bourne or Korn shell prompt

6
CODES

DBSDIR=/dbs; export DBSDIR

or the following at a C shell prompt
setenv DBSDIR /dbs

7

is equivalent to the above “symbol” keyword.

Note: If a symbolic name is defined by both an RC file and an
environment variable, the symbol statement value will be used.

“Keywords and Environment Variables” on page 281 of the
MSC.Nastran 2004 Installation and Operations Guide contains a list of
environment variables that are automatically created by the driver
program. Of particular importance to the logical symbol feature are the
OUTDIR and DBSDIR variables. These variables refer to the directory
that will contain the output files (set using the “out” keyword) and the
directory that will contain the permanent database files (set using the
“dbs” keyword), respectively.

you must manually exit XMONAST when the MSC.Nastran job has
completed. If “xmonast=kill” is specified, XMONAST will start and will
automatically exit when the MSC.Nastran job has completed.
Example:

This example runs the XMONITOR utility while the MSC.Nastran job is
running. Once the job completes, the XMONITOR program is
automatically terminated.

The NASTRAN Statement
The NASTRAN statement is used to specify values for certain Executive System
operational parameters. These parameters are also called system cells. The NASTRAN
statement is used for exceptional circumstances and is therefore not needed in most
runs. The NASTRAN statement may also be specified in the Runtime Configuration
(RC) files at the system, user, and job level as described in the MSC.Nastran 2005

3. More than one NASTRAN statement and/or DEFINE statement may be
present and, if a system cell is specified more than once among these
statements, then the last specification takes precedence.
4. The expression will use type conversion rules based on the type (i.e., integer,
real, or logical) of the cellname, as defined on a previous DEFINE statement
(see the DEFINE statement for conversion rules).
5. If expression is omitted, the system cell associated with the cellname will be
assigned the value as set on a previous DEFINE statement.

The File Management Section (FMS)
The File Management Section (FMS) is primarily intended for the attachment and
initialization of Database sets (DBsets) and FORTRAN files. The initialization of
DBsets includes specification of their maximum size, member names, and physical
filenames. The initialization of FORTRAN files includes the specification of their
filenames, FORTRAN unit numbers, and FORTRAN attributes.
In most classes of problems that use MSC.Nastran solution sequences (SOL), no File
Management statements are required because a default File Management Section is
executed at the beginning of every run. The default File Management Section is
described in the “Database Concepts” on page 513 of the MSC.Nastran Reference
Guide. If a restart is desired, then the RESTART statement is required. All other
solutions may not be restarted. If the problem is large in terms of requiring significant
amounts of memory or disk space, then the INIT, ASSIGN, and EXPAND statements
may be required. If any FORTRAN files are required, then the ASSIGN statement is
required; for example, the OUTPUT2 DMAP module. The ASSIGN statement is also
required to assign databases for DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, and DBUNLOAD. Special
database operations are performed by the DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, DBUNLOAD,
DBLCLEAN, ACQUIRE, DBDICT, DBFIX, DBSETDEL, DBUPDATE, and PROJECT
statements.

WHERE and CONVERT Clauses
The WHERE clause is used in the selection of items (data blocks and parameters) on
the DBDICT, DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, and DBUNLOAD statements. The CONVERT
clause modifies qualifier values of items selected by the WHERE clause on the
DBLOCATE and DBLOAD statements.
The WHERE and CONVERT clauses specify values for PROJECT, VERSION,
qualifiers, and DBSET. PROJECT specifies the project-ID that is originally defined on
the PROJECT FMS statement at the time the project is created. VERSION specifies the
desired version-ID under the project-ID. Qualifiers are used to uniquely identify items
on the database with the same name. For example, data block KAA has SEID as one of
its qualifiers, which is the superelement ID. An item may have more than one qualifier
and the collection of all qualifiers assigned to an item is called a path. All data blocks
and parameters with qualifiers are defined in the NDDL Sequence (NASTRAN Data
Definition Language), see MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP Programmer’s Guide. Data blocks
and parameters are defined on the DATABLK and PARAM NDDL statements. The
DATABLK and PARAM statements specify the name of the data block, parameter,
and also its pathname. The pathnames are defined on the PATH NDDL statement,
which lists the qualifiers assigned to the path. Qualifiers are defined on the QUAL
NDDL statement. DBSET specifies the desired DBset. The DBset of an item is specified
after the LOCATION keyword on the DATABLK and PARAM NDDL statement.
The format of the WHERE clause is:

7
SETS

8
BULK

WHERE (where-expr)
where-expr is a logical expression that specifies the desired values of qualifiers,
PROJECT, VERSION, and DBSET. If the result of the logical expression is TRUE for an
item on the database then the item is selected. For example, WHERE(VERSlON=4
AND SElD<>2 AND SElD>0) selects all items under version 4 for all values of SEID
greater than 0 except 2.

37

A simple where-expr is a comparison using the following relational operators =,>, <,
<=,>=, >< or <>. For example, SElD>0 means if SEID is greater than zero, then the
logical expression is true. Several simple where expressions may be joined into one
where expression by the following logical operators: AND, OR, XOR, and EQV. The
NOT operator may be used to negate a where expression. For example, NOT(SEID>0)
is the same as SEID<=0. Arithmetic operations and DMAP functions may also be
specified in the where expression (see the MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP Programmer’s
Guide.)
If a qualifier in a where-expr is not a qualifier in the path of a specified item, then the
where-expr is set to FALSE. If the where-expr does not contain a specification for all
qualifiers in the path of an item, then the unspecified qualifiers will be wildcarded
(i.e., quali=*, all values will be selected.) The default values of qualifiers, PROJECT,
VERSION, and DBSET are described under the statement in which the WHERE clause
is specified.
Examples of the WHERE clause are:
1. Select all items in the database for all superelements except 10 and 30 from
Version 1.
WHERE (VERSION=1 AND SEID>=0 AND NOT(SEID=10 OR SEID=30))
2. Select all entries in database on DBSET=DBALL from all projects and
versions.

WHERE(PROJECT=PROJECT AND VERSlON>0 AND DBSET=’DBALL’)
The CONVERT clause modifies project- and version-ID, DBset-name (see INIT
statement), and qualifier values of items selected by the WHERE clause on the
DBLOCATE and DBLOAD statements. It contains one or more assignment statements
separated by semicolons. The format of CONVERT clause is:
CONVERT(PROJECT=project-expr; VERSION=version-expr; ,
DBSET=DBset-expr;quali=qual-expri[;...])
The PROJECT and VERSION statements modify the project-ID (see PROJECT FMS
statement) and version-ID. The DBSET statement modifies the DBset-name. The value
of quali will be replaced by qual-expri for selected items that have quali in their path.
qual-expri is any valid expression (see “Expressions and Operators” on page 9 of the
MSC.Nastran 2004 DMAP Programmer’s Guide) containing constants or any qualifier
name defined in the path of the item. If qual-expri contains names of qualifiers not in
the path of the selected item, then a fatal message is issued. If project-expr and/or

version-expr produces a project- or version-ID which does not exist, then one will be
created. Also, all version-IDs less than version-expr that do not exist will be created;
but they will be “empty.”
Examples of the CONVERT clause are:
1. Set qualifiers SEID, PEID, and SPC to constants 10, 20, 102 respectively.

2
FMS

3
EXEC

CONVERT(SEID=10;PEID=20;SPC=102)
If more than one value of a qualifier is found for an item by the WHERE
clause, then each value is processed in qual-expri to define the new qualifier
value for each of the selected items. In the example below, if the original
values of PEID were 1, 2, and 3; then the new values for the SElD qualifier
will be 2, 4, and 6.
2. Set all values of qualifier SElD to be twice the value of the PEID qualifier.

8. If it is necessary to execute the INPUTT4 and OUTPUT4 modules on the
same unit, then specify ASSIGN OUTPUT4 only. The same is recommended
for the INPUTT2 and OUTPUT2 modules.
9. STATUS, UNIT, and FORM are ignored if assigning a log-name (DBset
member name).
10. FORM=FORMATTED must be specified for a unit when:

• ASCII output is desired from the OUTPUT4 DMAP modules that
processes the unit and, for Cray UNICOS, when ASCII input is
supplied to the INPUTT4 DMAP module that processes the unit. See
the MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP Programmer’s Guide.

• FORMAT=NEUTRAL is selected on the DBUNLOAD and DBLOAD
FMS statements that process the unit. See the “Database Concepts”
on page 513 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.

• The neutral file format is desired for the OUTPUT2 module and, for
Cray UNICOS, when ASCII input is supplied to the INPUTT2
module.
11. For the DBUNLOAD, OUTPUT2 and OUTPUT4 modules, binary format
may be requested using FORM=UNFORMATTED and, for all platforms
except Cray UNICOS, using FORM=BIGENDIAN,
FORM=LITTLEENDIAN, FORM=LTLEND or FORM=<ostype>. The
FORM=BIGENDIAN, FORM=LITTLEENDIAN, FORM=LTLEND and
FORM=<ostype> specifications are used when the generated output file is to
be processed on a platform other than current platform. The format
appropriate for the platform on which the file is to be processed (the target
platform) must be specified. FORM=LTLEND is equivalent to
FORM=LITTLEENDIAN. The FORM=<ostype> specification can by used as
a convenience, allowing the desired output format to be specified using the
target platform OS name or vendor (if there can be no ambiguity) instead of
its actual binary file format. <ostype> can be one of the following:

See the MSC.Nastran 2004 r3 Installation and Operations Guide for further

12. For all platforms except Cray UNICOS, the FORM= describer is ignored for
the DBLOAD, INPUTT2 and INPUTT4 modules. MSC.Nastran determines
the actual file format when it accesses the specified file. If the FORM=
describer is specified on an ASSIGN statement for these logical-keys, the
syntax of the describer will be validated but will otherwise be ignored. Note,
however, that the DBLOAD and INPUTT2 modules cannot process input
files in other than the native binary format. That is, a binary file in
BIGENDIAN format cannot be processed on a LITTLEENDIAN platform
and vice versa. For MSC.Nastran on Cray UNICOS, the FORM= describer is
required for the DBLOAD, INPUTT2 and INPUTT4 modules if the file does
not have the default format.
13. For the DBUNLOAD and OUTPUT2 modules, if FORM is other than
UNFORMATTED (or equivalent, e.g., BIGENDIAN on an AIX or HPUX
platform and LITTLEENDIAN on a Linux or Windows platform), then only
data blocks with an NDDL description are processed. (See the MSC.Nastran
2005 DMAP Programmer’s Guide under the DATABLK statement.) An
NDDL description is required for TYPE=TABLE and none is required for
TYPE=MATRIX. The data block must be processed with
FORM=UNFORMATTED if TYPE=UNSTRUCTURED, KDICT or KELM.
14. See the MSC.Nastran 2004 r3 Installation and Operations Guide for further
information on sys-spec controls and on machine-dependent aspects of the
ASSIGN statement. Also, if there are SYS specifications on more than one
ASSIGN statement specifying the same log-name or logical-key/UNIT
combination, the second and subsequent specifications will appended to the
current SYS specification with a comma separator.
15. Currently the RECL keyword is used by the DBC module and has a default
minimum of 1024 words. The maximum allowed is 65536 words and is used
to increase the database capacity.
16. The SIZE keyword is used by the DBC module and has a default of 16777215.
The maximum allowed is 2147483647 and is used to increase the database
capacity. MSC.Patran releases before 2001 should use the defaults for RECL
and SIZE or database verification failures will occur.

evaluator

Identifies the particular class of evaluator to which the geometric,
beam cross-section, or external response entities belong. Entities
belonging to one evaluator-class are handled by the same set of
(either MSC provided or user-provided) routines. for geometry,
two classes of evaluators are provided internally with
MSC.Nastran. They are MSCRPC (Rational Parametric Cubic) and
MSCEQN (Generic Equation). For beam cross-sections, the class
MSCBML (MSC Beam-Library) is provided internally. Users may
develop custom evaluator libraries for geometry, beam
cross-sections, or external responses and configure them for use
with MSC.Nastran. See Remarks 4., 5., and 7.

2. Two reserved group names, MSCGRP0 and MSCGRP1, have been
predefined for geometric entities. These names may be used in the GMCURV
and GMSURF entries, without being defined explicitly by means of a
CONNECT FMS statement. The group MSCGRP0 corresponds to the
MSCRPC (Rational Parametric Cubic) evaluator and the group MSCGRP1
corresponds to the MSCEQN (Generic Equation) evaluator.
3. A single reserved group name, MSCBML0 has been predefined for beam
cross-section entities. It may be used in the PBARL and PBEAML entries,
without being defined explicitly by means of a CONNECT FMS statement. It
corresponds to the MSCBML (MSC Beam-Library) evaluator.
4. Custom geometric evaluator libraries developed by users should comply
with the MSC.Nastran Geometry Evaluator Developer’s Guide.
5. Custom beam cross-section evaluator libraries developed by users should
comply with the guidelines in the MSC.Nastran V69 Release Guide, Section 3.1
Beam Cross-Section Library and Appendix C: Adding Your Own Beam
Cross-Section Library.
6. Custom responses developed by users should comply with the procedures
and guidelines in “Support of External Response in SOL 200” on page 55 of
the MSC.Nastran 2004 Release Guide.

• If the where-expr does not specify a colname that is assigned to the
data block (or parameter), then the qualifier is wildcarded. For

Remarks:
1. It is recommended that a backup copy of the database be made before this
statement is used since corrections of the database are achieved through the
deletion of data. Data blocks and parameters are deleted from the database
if they have (1) incorrect paths (different than listed in the NDDL), (2)
incorrect names (two or more names that are not equivalenced and reference
the same data), or (3) incorrect directory pointers.

Describer

Meaning

where-expr

A logical expression that specifies the desired values of qualifiers,
PROJECT, VERSION, and DBSET. For example,
WHERE(VERSlON=4 AND SElD<>2 AND SEID>0) selects all
items under version 4 for all values of SElD greater than 0 except 2.
See the beginning of this section on WHERE and CONVERT
clauses.

nastran

2
FMS

The default for VERSION is * for all versions; PROJECT is * for all
projects; and DBSET is* for all DBsets. The default for qual is *,
which is all qualifier values found on the loaded database. See also
Remark 8.

CASE

For example, CONVERT (SEID=100+SElD; SPC=102). See the

The default action for VERSION and PROJECT is to use the same
version lDs and project IDs; i.e., CONVERT(PROJECT=PROJECT;
VERSlON=VERSlON). But if either PROJECT or VERSION is
specified in the convert-expr, then both must be specified. The
default action for qualifiers and DBSET is to use the same values as
long as they are defined in both databases. If not, see Remark 8.

By default, if duplicate data blocks or parameters exist on the
loaded and primary databases, then a fatal message is issued. A
duplicate means that a data block or parameter has not only the
same name but also the same qualifier values, PROJECT,
VERSION, and DBSET as a data block or parameter on the primary
database.

NEUTRAL
BINARY

The database to be loaded may be in BINARY or NEUTRAL format.
BlNARY indicates the database to be loaded is in binary or

Remarks:
1. The DBLOAD statement and its applications are discussed further in
“Database Concepts” on page 513 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.
2. If the DATABLK keyword is specified and PARAM is not specified, then
only data blocks may be loaded. If the PARAM keyword is specified and
DATABLK is not specified, then only parameters may be loaded. If neither
DATABLK nor PARAM is specified, then all data blocks and parameters
may be loaded.
3. The DB keyword is equivalent to DATABLK, and the PARM keyword is
equivalent to PARAM.
4. The database to be loaded is attached as read-only. In other words, items can
only be fetched and not stored on this database.
5. If more than one DBLOAD statement is specified, then they will be processed
in the order in which they appear. If a duplicate data block or parameter is
found on two or more different DBLOAD statements, then the last duplicate
will be used.
6. If NEUTRAL is specified, then the FORMATTED keyword must be specified
on the corresponding ASSIGN statement.
7. If a data block or parameter is being renamed, then the new name must be
defined in the NDDL of the primary database.
8. If the database to be loaded and the primary database have different NDDL
schemes and CONVERT is not used, then the following is performed:

• If a qualifier in the NDDL of the database to be loaded is not in the
NDDL of the primary database, then all of its values are converted to
the null value corresponding to its type. For example, if the qualifier
is integer, real, double-precision, complex or character, then the value
is converted to 0, 0., 0.D0, (0.,0.), or blank, respectively. If this
conversion results in a duplicate data block(s) or parameter(s), then a
User Warning Message is printed and the duplicates are not loaded.

Meaning

datablk-list

Specifies a list of data blocks separated by commas. The default is
*, which selects all data blocks. The located data block may be
renamed in the primary database by specifying a slash after the old
name followed by the new name. For example, if KLL is to be
renamed to KLL1, then DATABLK=(KLL/KLL1) is specified.

param-list

Specifies a list of parameters separated by commas. The default is
*, which selects all parameters. The located parameter may be
renamed in the primary database by specifying a slash after the old
name followed by the new name. For example, if LUSETS is to be
renamed to LUSET, then PARAM=(LUSETS/LUSET) is specified.

where-expr

A logical expression that specifies the desired values of qualifiers,
PROJECT, VERSION, and DBSET. For example,
WHERE(VERSlON=4 AND SElD<>2 AND SElD>0) selects all
items under version 4 for all values of SEID greater than 0 except 2.

For example, CONVERT (SEID=100+SEID; SPC=102). See the
beginning of this section on WHERE and CONVERT clauses.
The default action for VERSION and PROJECT is to convert to the
current version-ID and current project-ID. But if either PROJECT or
VERSION is specified in the convert-expr, then both must be
specified. See Example 3. The default action for qualifiers and
DBSET is to use the same values as long both databases have the
same NDDL scheme. If not, see Remark 9.

DBLOCATE

Attaches Secondary Databases

Describer

Meaning

dbname

Specifies the logical name of the master directory DBset of the
located database. dbname must be specified on an ASSIGN
statement, which references the physical file name. By default, the
located database is also the primary database. (If dbname is
specified for the primary database, then dbname must be
MASTER.)

OVRWRT
NOOVRWRT

COPY

By default, duplicate data blocks or parameters on the located
database will take precedence over those on the primary database.
A duplicate means that a data block or parameter has not only the
same name but also the same qualifier values, PROJECT,
VERSION, and DBSET as the data block or parameter on the
primary database. If NOOVRWRT is specified, then a fatal message
is issued.
Requests that the located data blocks or parameters be copied to the
primary database.

Remarks:
1. The DBLOCATE statement and its applications are discussed further in the
“Database Concepts” on page 513 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.
2. If the DATABLK keyword is specified and PARAM is not specified, then
only data blocks may be located. If the PARAM keyword is specified and
DATABLK is not specified, then only parameters may be located. If neither
DATABLK nor PARAM is specified, then all data blocks and parameters

and can be subsequently broken as a result of regeneration and/or NDDL
dependencies.
7. If a data block or parameter is being renamed, then the new name must be
defined in the NDDL of the primary database.
8. If LOGICAL refers to the primary database and one version is to be copied
to another, then the items are equivalenced.
9. If the located database and the primary database have different NDDL
schemes and CONVERT is not used, then the following is performed:

• If a qualifier in the NDDL of the located database is not in the NDDL
of the primary database, then all of its values are converted to the null
value corresponding to its type. For example, if the qualifier is integer,
real, double precision, complex or character then the value is
converted to 0, 0., 0.D0, (0.,0.), or blank, respectively. If this conversion
results in a duplicate data block(s) or parameter(s), then a User
Warning Message is printed and the duplicates are not located.

• If a dbset-name in the NDDL of the located database is not in the
NDDL of the primary database, then its values will be converted to
the PARAM default value in the NDDL of the located database.

5. Directory updates are performed automatically at various points in the
execution of the DMAP in addition to those specified by DBUPDATE. An
asterisk appears after the word “BEGN” in the Executive Summary Table
whenever an update occurs. See the “Output Description” on page 373 of
the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide. These updates occur whenever a
permanent data block or parameter DMAP equivalence or restart
equivalence is broken. Updates also occur upon deletions. Additions to the
database do not automatically cause a directory update to take place.

DEFINE

Parameter Definition

Assigns user defined keywords (or cellnames) to NASTRAN system cell. (See the

Format:
DEFINE keyword [ =expression ] [ LOCATION=SYSTEM(i) ] [ TYPE=type ]
Describer

Meaning

keyword

User defined name, 1 through 24 characters in length. The first
character must be alphabetic. The following characters can be used
for keywords: A through Z, ’_" , and 0 through 9. Any other
characters are invalid.

expression

Expression produces a single value from a set of constant and/or
variable parameters separated by operators. The value is assigned
to the “keyword” and is also used to set the value for the
NASTRAN system cell specified by “LOCATION”. The TYPE
determines both the type of the result and the type conversions that
will be applied to the constants and variables within the
expression--mixed mode expressions are allowed (see Remark 6.).
The parentheses can be used to change the order of precedence.
Operations within parentheses are performed first with the usual
order of precedence being maintained within the parentheses. The
variable parameters within the expression must be keywords
previously defined on a DEFINE statement. The following

Statement for a list of internal default values).
3. A DEFINE statement that specifies a LOCATION is actually setting the
default for a NASTRAN system cell and therefore it is not necessary to also
set the system cell value on a subsequent NASTRAN statement, unless the
user wishes to override the previous DEFINE statement setting. Also, since
more than one DEFINE statement may be present for the same “keyword”

Parameter Definition

the last specification takes precedence. “Keywords” referenced on a
NASTRAN statement or in an expression on the DEFINE statement are
automatically substituted by the last specification of the “keyword” prior to
the current statement being processed.
4. DEFINE statements may also be specified in Runtime Configuration (RC)
files. See the MSC.Nastran 2005 Installation and Operations Guide.
5. System cells may also be set with the NASTRAN statement. In addition, they
may be set or values returned with the DMAP PUTSYS and GETSYS
functions and the PARAM module. See the MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP
Programmer’s Guide.
6. Each operand within the expression will be converted to the result type prior
to the arithmetic operation. For example: the statement “DEFINE JJ=2.5 + 3.6
TYPE=I” would result in 2.5 and 3.6 being converted to 2 and 3 respectively
and the result of 5 would be assigned to JJ.
Examples:
1. Change the default value for block size.
DEFINE BUFFSIZE=4097 LOCATION=SYSTEM(1)
2. Set the sparse matrix selection to forward-backward substitution only.
DEFINE SPARSE=16 LOCATION=SYSTEM(126)
3. Define the system cell keyword and default value for the maximum output
line count and then reset it to another value on a NASTRAN statement. Note:
The DEFINE statement would typically be placed in an RC file and the
NASTRAN statement would be placed in the File Management Section
whenever the user wants to override the DEFINE statement default setting.
DEFINE

MAXLINES=999999999 LOCATION=SYSTEM(9)

If the primary database is being created in the run, this option
requests that all DBsets in the primary database will be

the “nastran Command and NASTRAN Statement” on page 1. If
the run is a restart, then this option is ignored.

MEM
NOMEM

MEM=m specifies that m blocks of real memory are to be allocated

member should it reach its maximum size (max-sizei). The max-sizei may be
converted to words by multiplying by b. A summary of space usage and
allocation is printed at the end of the Execution Summary Table.
5. In restart runs, the INIT statement is ignored for pre-existing permanent
DBsets. The INIT statement is intended to be specified only in the run in
which the DBset is being created. If more DBset members need to be added
to the DBset, then the EXPAND statement is used.
6. If RAM or RAM=r is specified and the run terminates because the computer
operating system detects insufficient space or time or the computer halts due
to a power outage or operator interruption, then it may not be possible to
restart from the database. See the DBUPDATE FMS statement.

8. By default, the SCRATCH DBset is divided into two partitions: LOGICAL
and SCR300. The LOGICAL partition, log-names after the LOGICAL
keyword, are reserved for DMAP scratch data blocks and the SCR300
partition for DMAP module internal scratch files.

• The maximum total number of log-names for LOGICAL and SCR300
is 20. For example, if LOGICAL has 8 log-names, then SCR300 can
have no more than 12 log-names.

• If NASTRAN SYSTEM(142)=1 is specified, then the SCR300 partition
is not created and internal scratch files, along with DMAP scratch data
blocks will reside on the LOGICAL partition. The default is
SYSTEM(142)=2.

• If NASTRAN SYSTEM(151)=1 is specified and the LOGICAL
partition has reached its maximum size, then the SCR300 partition
will be used. The default is SYSTEM(151)=0.

• By default, the space specified for the SCR300 partition is released to
the operating system after each DMAP module is executed as long as
the module used more than 100 blocks for internal scratch files. If 100
blocks is not a desirable threshold, then it may be changed by
specifying NASTRAN SYSTEM(150)=t, where t is the number of
blocks for the threshold.

is recommended for all except very large problems. bmax must reflect the
maximum of b specified for all DBsets attached to the run, including the
delivery database. See MSC.Nastran 2005 Installation and Operations Guide for
the defaults of b and bmax.
10. If INIT MASTER(RAM=r) and INIT SCRATCH(MEM=m) are specified,

This section describes the Executive Control statements. These statements select a
solution sequence and various diagnostics.
Most Executive Control statements are order independent. The exceptions are the
COMPILE, COMPILER, ALTER, ENDALTER, and LINK statements. If used, the
LINK statement must appear after all COMPILE statements. The COMPILER
statement (or equivalent DIAGs) must appear before all COMPILE statements. The
COMPILER statement also sets the defaults for subsequent COMPILE statements.

Remarks:
1. The ALTER statement must be used in conjunction with the COMPILE
Executive Control statement. Note: ALTER statements cannot be used in
conjunction with an MALTER statement, and therefore, should never
immediately follow this statement.
2. If an MALTER statement is used in conjunction with the ALTER statement,
then the MALTER should be placed above the COMPILE statements. Failure
to place the MALTER in this position may cause ALTER statements to be
ignored.
3. The ALTERs can reference the DMAP statements in any order within a
subDMAP. Two restrictions on ordering are:

• K2 or ’string2’(occurence, offset) references must refer to a DMAP
statement number that is greater than or equal to the k1 or
’string1’(occurrence,offset) reference within a single ALTER
statement.

• K1 or ’string1’ and k2 or ’string2’ cannot overlap DMAP line positions
with another ALTER that references the same subDMAP.
4. The ’string1’ or ’string2’ used as a search pattern will apply to one complete
DMAP statement-i.e., a multiline DMAP statement will be searched for a
pattern match as if each 72 character line of the DMAP statement were
concatenated together into one string-all blanks and comments (either
embedded or immediately preceding the DMAP statement) will be retained.
However, comments are ignored for the following type of alter:
alter ‘^ *gp0’
5. Within a SUBDMAP, both ’string1’ and ’string2’ will be used to search for a
pattern match starting at the beginning of the subDMAP-not at the current
position of the last string match.
6. The special characters (metacharacters) used for string searching are
described in Remark 9. The characters <,>, and $, which are common DMAP
characters, are also special metacharacters. If they are to be used in the search
string as regular characters, then they must be preceded by a backward slash
(\). For example, to find the string

SOUIN=MSCSOU LIST requests a listing of the MSC.Nastran NDDL
sequence. The ACQUIRE FMS statement or the SOL statement must
be specified in order to attach the corresponding Delivery Database.

• To alter the MSC.Nastran NDDL sequences, the entire modified
NDDL sequence is included after the COMPILE statement and
SOUIN=souin-DBset is not specified.

• SOUOUT=souout-DBset requests the storage of the NDDL source
statements on the souout-DBset and may not be specified with
SOUIN=souin-DBset.
7. The COMPILER statement may be used to override the defaults of NOLIST,
NOREF, and NODECK. In other words, if LIST or NOLIST, REF or NOREF,

Default = dmp; if NUMDOM has any other value, it will automatically
be set to dmp (= no. of processors used for the run). The frequency
range will be divided into NUMDOM regions which are then solved
independently.
By default, the frequency range used for upstream component modes
is two times larger than the desired range on the EIGR/L entry. To
modify this factor, specify the UPFACT parameter (real; default=2.0).

TREE

Specifies the type of elimination tree to use:

(ACMS)

TREE = MULTI: binary multilevel tree (default)
A multilevel tree requires that the number of domains be a power of
two and be evenly divisible by dmp, the number of processors specified
for the run; otherwise a single level tree will be used automatically.

ALLOC

Determines how superelements are assigned to processors:

(ACMS)

ALLOC = STATIC: components are divided evenly at job start
(default)
ALLOC = DYNAMIC: components are assigned to processors on a
first come, first served basis. This option is effective when one or more
processor is heavily loaded and/or has a slower computational rate.
Controls intermediate print of upstream and data recovery processing
in F06 and F04 files. Default=’NO’. If PRINT=NO and an error occurs
upstream, the intermediate output is placed in a separate output file
named “jid.acms_out” for examination.

• Taper ratio for the quadrilateral element is defined to be the ratio of
the area of the triangle formed at each corner grid point to one half the
area of the quadrilateral. The largest of the four ratios is compared
against the tolerance value. It may be noted that as the ratio
approaches 1.0, the shape approaches a rectangle.

• Surface warping factor for a quadrilateral is defined to be the distance
of the corner points of the element to the mean plane of the grid points
divided by the average of the element diagonal lengths. For flat
elements (all of the grid points lie in a plane), this factor is zero.

• The edge point length ratio test is only performed for the solid

elements when edge node points exist. The test evaluates the relative
position of the edge node point along a straight line connecting the
two vertex nodes of that edge. Ideally, the edge point should be
located on this line at a point midway between the two end points.
The default tolerance allows the edge node to be positioned anywhere
between the two quarter points on this line. In addition, the angles
between the lines joining the edge node and the end points are
determined. If the angle is greater than 30° , then the edge point
length ratio test is considered violated and a diagnostic message will
be generated if appropriate.

• The face warp coefficient test tolerance is the cosine of the angle
formed between the normal vectors located at diagonally opposite
corner points on each face surface. This value is 1.0 for a face where all
4 corners lie in a plane. The default tolerance allows angles of up to
45° before a message is generated.

4. When SUMMARY is not specified, each geometry test that exceeds the
tolerance will be identified in the single line output summary by an indicator
based on the specification for MSGTYPE. For the FATAL option, the

2. The MALTER statement can reference the DMAP statements in any order
within a subDMAP. Two restrictions on ordering are:

• K2 or ’string2’(occurence,offset) references must refer to a DMAP line
number that is greater than or equal to the k1 or
’string1’(occurrence,offset) reference within a single MALTER
statement.

• ’string1’ and k2 or ’string2’ cannot overlap DMAP line positions with
another MALTER that references the same subDMAP.
3. The ’string1’ or ’string2’ used as a search pattern will apply to one complete
DMAP statement-i.e., a multiline DMAP statement will be searched for a
pattern match as if each 72 character line of the DMAP statement were
concatenated together into one string-all blanks and comments (either
embedded or immediately preceding the DMAP statement) will be retained.
4. The special characters used for string searching are described in Remark 9.
The characters <, >, and $, which are common DMAP characters, are also
special metacharacters. If they are to be used in the search string as regular
characters, then they must be preceded by a backward slash (\). For

Matches any single character except newline.

*

Matches any number (including zero) of the single character
(including a character specified by a regular expression) that
immediately precedes it. For example, since “.” (dot) means any
character, “.*” means “match any number of characters.”

[...]
or< >

Matches any one of the characters enclosed between the
brackets. For example, “[AB]” matches either “A” or “B”. A
range of consecutive characters can be specified by separating
the first and last characters in the range with a hyphen. For
example “[A-Z]” will match any uppercase letter from A to Z
and “[0-9]” will match any digit from 0 to 9. Some
metacharacters lose special meaning inside brackets. A
circumflex (^) as the first character in the bracket tries to match
any one character not in the list.

Note:

Nonportable characters such as [ ] and ^ should be replaced

and it is strongly suggested that alters which use the MALTER command
take advantage of the unique MALTER labels. Use of the MALTER labels

Remarks:
1. If SOLIN keyword is not given and if there are no LINK statements within
the input data, the program will perform an automatic link. The program
will first collect the objects created in the current run by the COMPILE
statement and the remaining objects stored in the MSCOBJ DBset. The
program will then perform an automatic link of the collected objects.
2. If the SOLIN keyword is not given but a LINK statement is provided, the
SOLIN default will be obtained from the SOLOUT keyword on the LINK
statement.
3. The OSCAR (Operation Sequence Control ARray) defines the problem
solution sequence. The OSCAR consists of a sequence of entries with each
entry containing all of the information needed to execute one step of the
problem solution. The OSCAR is generated from information supplied by
the user’s entries in the Executive Control Section.
4. The SOLIN keyword will skip the automatic link and execute the OSCAR on
the specified DBset.

SOL 600,ID is a new Executive Control statement like SOL. The difference between
SOL and SOL 600,ID is that the computations (element matrix formulations, matrix
decomposition, etc.) will be performed by MSC.Marc rather than directly within
MSC.Nastran. Inputs and outputs as much as possible will be the same as (or similar
to) the familiar MSC.Nastran inputs and outputs. The SOL 600,ID statement should
normally be used only for nonlinear analysis, but it may also be used for certain
classes of linear static or dynamic analyses. The recommended form of this command
is shown with the options provided above. If entered with "SOL 600,ID" only, it acts
just like SOL except a MSC.Marc input data file “jid.marc.dat” will be generated ["jid"
is the name of the MSC.Nastran input file without the extension. For example, if the
MSC.Nastran input file is named abcd.dat, (or abcd.bdf) then "jid"=abcd].
The required ID represents many valid solution sequence integer or names shown in
Table 3-4 for the SOL statement. Examples are 106, 129, NLSTATIC, NLTRAN. The
following solutions are not available: 107, 110, 114, 115, 116, 118, 144, 145, 146, 153, 159,
190, 200, and 400 (and their equivalent names). Solutions specified in Table 3-4 of the
SOL statement may be used except for 7, 10, 14-16 and their equivalent names. In
future releases, the heat transfer solutions will be added.
All items on the SOL 600,ID after ID itself may be specified in environmental variables.
This may be done any way environmental variables can be set. They may be set by the
MSC.Nastran user at run time or by the system administrator when MSC.Nastran is
installed. Any values specified on the SOL statement override those in the
environment. Environmental variables are fully described in the MSC.Nastran Release
Guide. A keywords file is available to describe the format of each variable. The
variable is normally set in the system-wide rc file, a user’s rc file, a local rc file or in a
script used to submit MSC.Nastran. Any string or value listed on the SOL 600,ID
statement is also valid as an environmental variable. If the environmental variables

SOL 600,ID

147

Executes MSC.Marc from Inside MSC.Nastran

are placed in the system-wide rc file, they may be used by a company for all
MSC.Nastran users and even hide the fact that MSC.Marc is being spawned if so
desired.
The following environmental variables are available:

PATH
PATH is an optional item which determines the location of the version of MSC.Marc
to be executed. If PATH is omitted, a special version of MSC.Marc included with
MSC.Nastran will be used if it can be located. In this case, the run script for MSC.Marc
(run_marc or run_marc.bat) will be expected to be in the directory
/MSC_BASE/marc/MSC_ARCH/marc2003/tools. MSC_BASE and MSC_ARCH are
environmental variable set when MSC.Nastran first starts execution that define the
base installation directory for MSC.Nastran and the machine type such as aix, linux,
hpux, alpha, irix, solaris, i386,etc. If for some reason MSC_BASE and/or MSC_ARCH
cannot be determined, the commands to spawn MSC.Marc will fail and the user must
re-run MSC.Nastran with one of the PATH options set or the NASM_PATH
environmental option set to the desired location of MSC.Marc’s tools directory.

PATH=1
If PATH=1 is specified, then MSC.Nastran will determine the proper command to
execute the companion program. To aid MSC.Nastran in determining the program’s
location, the marcrun.pth file must be available in the same directory where the
MSC.Nastran input file resides. The marcrun.pth file must contain one line providing
the location (complete path) of the run_marc script. A typical example of the line in
the file marcrun.pth would be

MSC.Marc .out or .log files. The replacement string may be any string desired and can
be the same length, shorter or longer than the MSC.Marc string. The two strings must
be separated by at least one space, but more spaces are acceptable. Line lengths for

MSC.Nastran, but standard MSC.Marc .out, .t16 and/or .t19 as well as an op2 file will
be available depending on the options selected with PARAM,MARCT16,

Option 1: Specify a String of Desired Output Types: (Preferred
Method)
OUTR=OP2,F11,F06,PCH,XDB,T16,T19,PST
Use any or all of the above to request the following options:
OP2

Create output2 file named jid.op2 consisting of input model and output
results datablocks. This option requires PARAM,POST,-1 in the Bulk Data.

F11

Create output filed fort.11 or ftn11 (depending on the computer system)
consisting of output results datablocks only.

F06

Put MSC.Marc output results (displacements, stresses, strains) in
MSC.Nastran’s jid.f06 file using OFP. The resulting output will look just like
any standard MSC.Nastran run.

PCH

Create punch file named jid.pch with MSC.Marc’s output in standard
MSC.Nastran punch format.

XDB

eig

The eig option must be specified if op2, xdb, pch, or f06 options are specified
and MSC.Marc performs natural frequency or buckling eigenvalue analysis.
The reason it must be provided on the SOL entry is to enable MSC.Nastran
to create DMAP on the fly which include the LAMA data block. If the eig
option is omitted, eigenvectors will be present in the MSC.Nastran output
but no eigenvalues will be available. The beam and eig options are mutually
exclusive (you cannot specify both).

BEAM

The BEAM option must be specified if op2, xdb, pch, or f06 options are
specified and you want to place internal loads in any of these files.The
BEAM option is not available for Windows systems.

T16

MSC.Marc’s results will be saved during the MSC.Marc execution on a
binary (or unformatted) file named jid.marc.t16 (this happens by default and
does not need to be specified on the SOL 600 line).

T19

PST

DMAP

MSC.Marc’s results will be saved during the MSC.Marc execution on an
ASCII file named jid.marc.t19. The t19 file will normally be saved if
param,maract19,1 is entered.
MSC.Nastran will be run to output a previous MSC.Marc run’s results
contained on file jid.marc.t16 or jid.marc.t19 in the desired forms
(OP2,F11,F06,PCH and/or XDB). The appropriate T16 or T19 options must
be selected in addition to PST and one or more of OP2,F11,F06,PCH and/or
XDB. MSC.Nastran will not run past IFP and is used only to perform the
desired output results conversions.
The user will enter his own DMAP to create whatever type of output that is
desired, such as op2, xdb, pch, or .f06. For all other options, DMAP as needed
is generated internally by NASTRAN.

Option 2: Specify an integer to Select Options Shown in the
following Table: (Not Recommended)
OUTR=1 or 2, an op2 file named fort.11 or ftn11 will be produced and DMAP as

STOP
STOP is an optional item. STOP is used to prevent execution of MSC.Marc or exit
MSC.Nastran after IFP, if so desired. DO NOT ENTER any of the STOP options if any
of the OUTR options are entered as the DMAP generated automatically by
MSC.Nastran will put an EXIT in the proper place. The various options are as follows:

STOP=3
STOP=3 is a combination of STOP=1 and STOP=2. MSC.Nastran is stopped after IFP
and MSC.Marc is not executed. This would be the normal STOP option if the user
wants to examine a MSC.Marc input file, then execute MSC.Marc manually.

Remarks:
1. The function of SOL 600,ID can alternatively be controlled by parameters
(marc3d, marcrun, marconly, marccpy, marcver) provided at the end of this
document. It is suggested that either SOL 600,ID or the parameters be
entered, not both. Creation of op2, xdb, pch, etc. output must be controlled
by using the OUTR option on SOL 600,ID.
2. Only one SOL 600,ID job may be run in a directory at any given time.
However, if a previous run was made and output files such as name.marc.t16
were produced, they will be renamed name.marc.t16.1, etc. following the
MSC.Nastran re-naming convention.
3. For the DMAP input by hand involving OUTR, change NLSTATIC to the
proper subdmap name if you are running a solution other than nonlinear
statics (SOL 106). Omit OUGV1 if displacements are not desired. Omit
OES1 is stress output is not desired. Omit OSTR1 is strain output is not
desired. The type of strain output (total, plastic or elastic) is controlled by
parameter MARCEKND (see the parameter section).
4. If OUTR is specified, STOP must not be specified.

5. The COPYR option can be used to delete all files directly created by
MSC.Marc if the only output desired are MSC.Nastran files.
6. When OUTR is negative and output processing takes place, the MSC.Marc
files such as jid.marc.out, jid.marc.t16 will be renamed to jid.marc.out.1 and
jid.marc.t16.1 at the start of the run. This renaming is accounted for when
opening the files. However, do not start with files named jid.marc.t16.1 or
jid.marc.t16.2 etc. for this option.
7. To generate xdb files, PARAM,POST,0 must be included in the Bulk Data
Section. To generate OP2 files with geometry, PARAM,POST,-1 should be
included in the Bulk Data.
8. For Windows systems, all MARCOUT options require a secondary program
named t16op2.exe which may be placed in any directory on the path or in the
MSC.Marc installation directory. For Windows systems, this program is
spawned from MSC.Nastran if any MARCOUT options are requested and
creates a fort.11 file. The rest of the steps to create op2, xdb, pch, or f06
output are the same as for UNIX systems. This requirement is necessary due
to the use of different compilers by MSC.Nastran and MSC.Marc for
Version 2003. The requirement may be lifted for future versions.
9. The ID or the largest GRID number or element number must be equal to or
greater than the ID of the largest property or material number.
10. Although SOL 600,ID supports linear analysis (ID=101, 103, 105), not all
features are available. For example, Case Control entries STATSUB,
SUBCOM, SUBSEQ, SYMCOM, AUXMODEL, AXISYMMETRIC, CLOAD,
DEFORM, HARMONICS, MFLUID, NSM, and REPCASE are not available.
For nonlinear analyses (ID=106, 129) Case Control entries NLLOAD and
NONLINEAR are not available.

Restrictions and Limitations of MSC.Nastran Implicit
Nonlinear (SOL 600)
Because MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600) is a new product, and since
certain features are available in MSC.Nastran that are not available in MSC.Marc, and
vice versa, the following restrictions/limitations are imposed on MSC.Nastran 2004.
Those restrictions indicated by (*) will be removed as soon as possible. Items with (**)
will issue a severe warning (for the MSC.Nastran-to-MSC.Marc translator internal to
MSC.Nastran) and MSC.Marc will not be “spawned” from MSC.Nastran unless
NOERROR is entered on the SOL 600 statement.

Example:
SOL 700,129 PATH=3 OUTR=OP2 NP=4
(700,129 request nonlinear transient dynamics, path=3 requests use of the dytranlsdyna script, outr=op2 requests that an op2 file, np=4 requests that 4 processors be
used)
Summary:
SOL 700 is a new Executive Control statement like SOL. It normally activates an
explicit nonlinear transient analysis integration scheme using dytran-lsdyna. It may
also be used for implicit static analyses using LS-Dyna’s Dynamic Relaxation or slow
buildup options. The calculations will not be performed directly within MSC.Nastran.
Instead, SOL 700 will use a separate solver based on LS-Dyna, spawned from
MSC.Nastran. This client-server approach is similar to SOL 600, using MSC.Marc. For
linear analyses such as normal modes, frequency response, or linear direct transient
response, MSC.Nastran should be used.

For the first phase of this project, the SOL 700 statement will spawn dytran-lsdyna,
which uses a Dytran text input interface to LS-Dyna. dytran-lsdyna is a 3D, explicit
nonlinear analyses code with DMP (parallel processing domain decomposition)
capabilities.

X-Y PLOT

For Phase 2 of the project and beyond, fluid coupling, airbags, seat belts, and dummy
passengers will be added. Then you can select the standard MSC.Dytran program or
an enhanced dytran-lsdyna program.

PARAM

Inputs and outputs will be the same as or similar to the familiar MSC.Nastran inputs
and outputs or, at, your option, LS-Dyna type outputs will be available. The LS-Dyna
style outputs are the default for SOL 700.
For ID=129 or NLTRAN, SOL 700 will generate a dytran-lsdyna input data file,
jid.dytran.dat, where “jid” is the name of the MSC.Nastran input file without the
extension). For example, if the MSC.Nastran input file is named abcd.dat, (or
abcd.bdf) then “jid”=abcd).

PARAM

Unless specified differently using the STOP= option, dytran-lsdyna will be executed
from MSC.Nastran on any computer system capable of doing so (which includes most
UNIX systems and Windows systems). For dytran-lsdyna to run, it must be installed,
properly licensed, and accessible from the directory where the MSC.Nastran input
data resides, MSC_BASE must be provided in the environment.
Executive Control Parameters:
The required ID may be one of several valid solution sequence integers or names
shown in table 3-4 of the MSC.Nastran 2004 QRG for the SOL statement. Examples
are 129 and NLTRAN.
The following solutions are available for Phase I of this project: 101, 106, 109, 129 (and
their equivalent names).
All items on the SOL 700,ID after ID itself may be specified in environmental variables.
This may be done any way environmental variables can be set. They may be set by the
MSC.Nastran user at run time or by the system administrator when MSC.Nastran is
installed. Any values specified on the SOL statement override those in the
environment. Environmental variables are fully described in the MSC.Nastran 2005
Installation and Operations Guide. A keywords file is available to describe the
format of each variable. The variable is normally set in the system-wide rc file, a user’s
rc file, a local rc file or in a script used to submit MSC.Nastran. Any string or value
listed on the SOL 700,ID statement is also valid as an environmental variable. If the
environmental variables are placed in the system-wide rc file, they may be used by a
company for all MSC.Nastran users and even hide the fact that dytran-lsdyna is being
spawned if so desired.

The following describes the various options for PATH. We suggest that PATH=3 for
Linux and UNIX and path=1 for Windows.

1
nastran

PATH=1
If PATH=1 is specified, MSC.Nastran will determine the proper command to execute
a serial dytran-lsdyna run. To aid MSC.Nastran in determining where dytran-lsdyna
is located, the dynrun.pth file must be located in the same directory where the
MSC.Nastran input file resides. The dynrun.pth file must contain one line providing
the location (complete path) of the dytran-lsdyna run script. A typical example of the
line in the file dynrun.pth follows.
Windows

c:\sol700\

Unix, Linux:

/msc/users/sol700

A string is appended to this path to form the complete command used to execute
dytran-lsdyna.
“dytran-lsdyna jid=name.dytr.dat
O=name.dytr,d3hsp G=name.dytr.d3plot D=name.dytr.d3dump
F=name.dytr.d3thdt
A=name.dytr.runrsf B=name.dytr.d3drfl
For Windows, MSC.Nastran will spawn dytrna-lsdyna using the following command
assuming the MSC.Nastran input data is named enf2e.dat. (Although the example
appears like it is on multiple lines, it is actually on a single line.)
c:\sol700/dytran-lsdyna i=enf2e.dytr.dat O=enf2e.dytr.d3hsp G=enf2e.dytr.d3plot

dynrun.pth is not required.

PATH=3
If PATH=3 is specified, a script or batch file to execute dytran-lsdyna located in the
same directory as the dytran-lsdyna executable will be executed. The name of the
script or batch files is run_dytran (or run_dytran.bat). This directory and name of the

STOP=3
STOP=3 MSC.Nastran is stopped after IFP and dytran-lsdyna is not executed. This
would be the normal STOP option if the user wants to examine a dytran-lsdyna input

A note of clarification about UNITS and its relation to MSC.Nastran’s
WTMASS parameter: WTMASS, though necessary to achieve units
consistency in MSC.Nastran, is ignored in the output for MSC.ADAMS.
Units data for MSC.ADAMS is supplied on the UNITS DTI entry. For
example, the user models mass in grams, force in Newtons, length in meters
and time in seconds. The WTMASS parameter is set to 0.001, thereby
ensuring that MSC.Nastran works with the consistent set of kg, N and m.
The units reported to ADAMS should be: “DTI, UNITS, 1, GRAM, N, M, S.”
On the other hand, consider the case where length is being modeled in inches
and force in pounds. Mass may either be modeled in slug units with
WTMASS set to 0.083 (=1/12), or in units of pounds mass with WTMASS set
to 0.00259 (=1/(32.34*12)). The UNITS choices are therefore either “DTI,
UNITS, 1, SLUG, LBJ, IN, S”, or “DTI, UNITS, 1, LBM, LBF, IN, S.” The
practice of applying the WTMASS parameter directly to the mass (e.g.,
specifying density in terms of [12slug/in**3]) is not acceptable because
[12slug] is not a mass unit known to ADAMS.
7. OUTSTRS or OUTSTRN entries require the use of the standard MSC.Nastran
STRESS= or STRAIN= commands to produce element stress or strain.
STRESS(PLOT)= or STRAIN(PLOT)= will suppress stress or strain print to
the MSC.Nastran .f06 file. The OUTSTRS or OUTSTRN entries are primarily
for ADAMS/Durability with MSC.Fatigue.

ADAMSMNF

Control for MSC.Nastran/MSC.ADAMS Interface

8. OUTGSTRS or OUTGSTRN entries require the use of the standard
MSC.Nastran STRESS= or STRAIN= used in conjunction with GPSTRESS=
or GPSTRAIN=commands to produce grid point stress or strain.
GPSTRESS(PLOT)= or GPSTRAIN(PLOT)= will suppress grid stress or
strain print to the MSC.Nastran .f06 file.
9. To reduce the FE mesh detail for dynamic simulations, PSETID=set_entry
defined with a SET entry is used to define a set of PLOTELs or other elements
used to select grids to display the component in ADAMS. This option can
significantly reduce the size of the MNF without compromising accuracy in
the ADAMS simulation providing that the mass invarient computation is
requested.
If the SET entry points to an existing set from the OUTPUT(PLOT) section of
MSC.Nastran, this single set is used explicitly to define elements used to
select grids to display the component in ADAMS. If PSETID=set_entry does
not find the set ID in OUTPUT(PLOT), it will search sets in MSC.Nastran
Case Control for a matching set ID. This matching set ID list then represents
a list of OUTPUT(PLOT) defined elements sets, the union of which will be
used to define a set of PLOTELS or other elements used to select grids to
display the component in ADAMS. If the user wishes to select all of the sets
in the OUTPUT(PLOT) section, then use PSETID=ALL.
The elements defined may include rigid element IDs. When defining these
sets do not use EXCLUDE and EXCEPT descriptions.
If superelement analysis is being used, any element defined on the
PSETID=set_entry that lies entirely on the superelement boundary (that is to
say all of its grids are a-set or exterior to the superelement) must also be
specified on a SEELT Bulk Data entry. The SEELT entry would not be
required for parts superelement as boundary elements stay with their
component.

For MSC.Nastran 2004, to insure compatibility with the MSC.Adams
msc2mnf tool kit, if the ADAMSMNF Case Control command has the
keyword ADMOUT=YES, the MSC.Nastran SYSTEM word OP2NEW is
automatically set to OP2NEW=0. This means that any output2 files
generated will have a pre-MSC.Nastran 2004 format.
11. ADAMS/Flex environment variables controlling MNF generation can be set
by doing a setenv or export before submitting the MSC.Nastran job or by use
of the MSC.Nastran keyword ’MNFWRITEOPTIONS’ which can be
abbreviated to any short unique string such as ’MNFW’. The MSC.Nastran
key word can be entered on the nastran submittal command line or in a user
.nastran rc file.
For example, interior grids and element can be removed in the MNF by
entering prior to the MSC.Nastran submittal;
with Korn shell:
export MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS=strip_face
with C shell:
setenv MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS=strip_face
Or, at MSC.Nastran submittal time:

12. MNF naming convention is as follows: for a single superelement run
’jid.mnf’; for a residual ony or multiple superelement run ’jid_seid.mnf’, etc.,
where seid1 and seid2 are the integer numbers of the superelement. The
default location of these files is the same directory as the jid.f06 file. See the
ASSIGN MNF command to change directory location.
13. When supplying SPOINTS/QSETS combinations there should be enough
supplied to capture accurately the modal shapes. If n is the number of modes
specified on the EIGR or EIGRL Bulk Data entries and p is the number of load
cases specified, then the number of SPOINTS(ns) should at least be
ns = n + ( 6 + p ) assuming that residual flexibility is on. In general, there
cannot be too many SPOINTS as excess ones will be simply truncated with
no performance penalty.
14. The user can have MSC.Nastran supply the SPOINTS/QSETS by including
above the Case Control the parameter PARAM,AUTQSET,YES. In this case
no SPOINTS/QSETS can appear in the Bulk Data. See the
PARAM,AUTQSET description for detailed requirements or limitations.

aerodynamic extra point vector about which the stability derivatives are to be
computed and printed. The stability derivatives are the change in force due to a unit
perturbation of each parameter in the aerodynamic extra point set. Due to the
nonlinear nature of the aeroelastic loads, the stability derivatives can be (but are not
required to be) a function of the point about which the slope is computed. This input
defines which point is to be used in computing the stability derivatives for printing
(local slopes will be computed as needed in the trim solver). This selection is typically
done within each subcase, but a case control default can be defined by placing an entry
above the subcase level.

1. AUTOSPC specifies the action to take when singularities exist in the stiffness
matrix. AUTOSPC=YES means that singularities will be constrained
automatically. AUTOSPC=NO means that singularities will not be
constrained. If AUTOSPC=NO then the user should take extra caution
analyzing the results of the grid point singularity table and the computed
epsilons. See “Constraint and Mechanism Problem Identification in
SubDMAP SEKR” on page 409 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide for
details of singularity and mechanism identification and constraint.
2. Singularity ratios smaller than EPSSING are listed as potentially singular. If
AUTOSPC=YES then the identified singularities with a ratio smaller than
EPS will be automatically constrained. If EPSSING has the same value as EPS
then all singularities are listed. If EPSSING is large than EPS, the printout of
singularity ratios equal to exactly zero is suppressed. EPSSING must be
greater than or equal to EPS. If not, then the program will set EPSSING equal
to EPS.
3. If the PUNCH keyword is specified then automatically generated SPCs or
MPCs are placed in SPCi or MPCi Bulk Data entry format on the PUNCH
file.
4. Default equals YES for all solutions except for SOLs 106 and 153. The
AUTOSPC operation provides the correct action for superelements in all
contexts. However, AUTOSPC may over-constrain the residual structure in
SOL 129. User PARAMeter, AUTOSPC, not the AUTOSPC command is used
for the o-set (omitted set) in the residual structure in SOLs 106 and 153.
5. The MPC option may be somewhat more expensive than the SPC option. It,
however, provides a more realistic structural modeling than the SPC. When
the MPC option is selected, the multipoint constraint may be applied on
some degree of freedom on which the stiffness matrix is identified as
singular. If MPC is inapplicable on some degree of freedom, the SPC is used
instead.

BCONTACT

Selects 3D Contact Surfaces

Selects the contact table and contact parameters for the current subcase. It is required
that this case control command be entered with one of the options shown below for
any 3D contact to occur. This command may be entered above any subcases to apply
to all subcases, however doing so will invoke an option such that rigid contact bodies
will just touch each other before the nonlinear simulation begins (for MSC.Marc users,
this is known as step zero).
If there are multiple subcases, then the BCONTACT Case Control command can be
entered before the first subcase to move rigid contact bodies together before the
nonlinear solution begins. BCONTACT may be specified within each subcase to
define which bodies may make contact during that particular subcase. If no
BCONTACT entries are made within a particular subcase and one is entered before
any subcase entries, it will be used for that subcase.

sum of applied and thermal loads, and MPC and SPC forces. Effects not
accounted for include those from mass elements in dynamic analysis (inertia
loads), general elements, DMIG entries, slideline force contributions and
boundary loads from upstream superelements. These effects may lead to an

Remarks:
1. When used in superelement analysis, this command must be used for all
superelements. The number of static load vectors created for each
superelement depends upon the type of analysis. In static analysis, the
number of vectors created is equal to the number of unique EXCITEIDs on
all LSEQ entries in the Bulk Data; in dynamic analysis, the number of vectors
created is equal to the number of unique EXCITEIDs on all RLOAD1,
RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2 and ACSRCE entries in the Bulk Data.
2. When the LOADSET command is used in superelement statics, the residual
structure should have as many loading conditions as the number of unique
EXCITEID sets defined on all LSEQ entries. The subcases after the first
should contain only SUBTITLE and LABEL information and residual
structure output requests. SUBTITLE and LABEL information for all
superelements will be obtained from the residual structure.
3. When more than one subcase is used with solution sequences 8, 9, 11 and 12
and the coupled mass option is used with CBAR elements, the LOADSET
must appear above all subcases. Only one LOADSET may be specified.
4. In SOL 101, the design sensitivity output will identify all expanded subcases
by a sequence of unique integers beginning with n.
5. In the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106 and 153) the LOADSET
must appear above all subcases and only one LOADSET may be specified.
6. Only one LOADSET command is allowed per superelement.

loading data for use in dynamic analysis. In the absence of LOADSET
request in Case Control, all static loads whose load set IDs match the
EXCITEID IDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2 and ACSRCE
entries in the Bulk Data are automatically processed.

1
nastran

EXEC

Remarks:
1. The MAXMIN command produces an algebraically ascending sorted list of
the output quantities specified for all of the points in the selected set. MAX
refers to the largest magnitude positive values, while MIN refers to the
largest magnitude negative values. The output format is similar to that of
displacement output. All components will be output for a grid point and the
order of the grid points will be in sort on the particular component that was
surveyed. The output title contains the identification number of the SET of
points participating in the max/min output, the coordinate system frame of
reference, the number of MAX and MIN values output and the component
that was surveyed. When the output being surveyed is in the global output
coordinate system reference frame and BASIC or a local output coordinate
system is specified as cid, both the sorted system output and the original
reference system output are displayed for the grid point if these systems are
different.
2. Vector magnitude results are computed for both translations and rotations
and displayed under the T1 and R1 column headings. The presence of the
COMP keyword is ignored.
3. The default value of 5 generates a minimum of 10 output lines for the BOTH
option. There will be 5 maximum values and 5 minimum values produced.
In addition, if coordinate system are involved, both surveyed and original
data will be output. This could result in as many as 10 more lines of output
for each surveyed component.

MAXMIN (DISP, COMP=T3) = 501
MAXMIN (SPCF, COMP=T1/R3) = ALL
5. Scalar point output is included only if component T1 is included in the list.
6. MAXMIN output will only be generated for items in the oplist when there is
an associated case control command present. For example, a DISP Case
Control command must be present in order for the MAXMIN(DISP) = ALL
command to produce output. Use of ALL keywords for the oplist requests
MAXMIN output for all of the output commands acceptable to MAXMIN
that are present in case control.

2. MAXMIN(DEF) may be specified more than once.
3. Multiple element types may be grouped together if the same component
name is to be monitored across those types by enclosing the element types in
parentheses.
4. Multiple component names may be compared collectively to the current
maximum (or minimum), but only the maximum (or minimum) component
in the group will be reported in the output. This is requested by enclosing the
component names in parentheses.
5. Grid point component output is always converted to the basic coordinate
system for monitoring when processing "sort1". The global system is the
default when processing in "sort2".
6. Results for layers in composite elements or intermediate stations in CBAR
and CBEAM elements are not supported.
7. Only real data recovery is currently supported.
8. When no MINA, MAXA or ABSO keyword is supplied, the default values of
p, q, and s will be 5. When any keyword is supplied, the other unreferenced
keyword values will be set to zero, and no output will be created.
9. The component action keywords of CENTER, ALL, GROUP, and ENDS can

Remarks:
1. The MCFRACTION command is useful in modal frequency response (SOL
111), modal transient response (SOL 112) and modal complex eigenvalue
analysis (SOL 110) solution sequences only. If superelements are used, its use
is restricted to residual structure data recovery operations only.
2. Both PRINT and PUNCH may be requested.
3. Printed output includes results for all of the data items described in the
itemlist table.
4. Punched output includes results for only the data items selected by the
ITEMS keyword.
5. Modal Contribution Fractions are sorted by increasing order of mode
number unless the SORT keywords specifies a particular sorting order. If a
sorting order is specified, the KEY keyword selects the particular data item
in the printed results tabular output listing that is sorted. When MODEDISP
is selected, the magnitude is sorted. When MODERESP is selected, the real
portion of the response is sorted.
6. The SOLUTION keyword can be used to select a subset of the solutions
available. If SET m is specified, the items in the SET list are forcing frequency
values, time step values or complex eigenvalue mode numbers depending
upon the solution sequence used.
7. The FILTER keyword specifies a filter ratio value that is used to limit the
amount of printed output produced. It applies to the data item selected by
the KEY keyword if it is specified. If no KEY keyword is present, the default
value od KEY=FRACTION will be used. The maximum value for the
selected data item across all natural modes is determined. If the ratio of the
data item value to the maximum data item value is less than fratio for any
natural mode, no output for that natural mode is produced.

MCFRACTION

329

Modal Contribution Fractions Output Request

8. If the magnitude of the total response at a selected grid pint component is
less than 1.0 × 10–ipowr , no modal contribution fraction output is generated for
that degree-of-freedom. If ipowr is not in the range of 1 to 31, the default
value of 12 is used for ipowr producing a null response threshold of
– 12
1.0 × 10 .
9. For modal transient response solution sequences, response quantities are
real numbers. There are no imaginary terms. Therefore, polar
representations of the data have no meaning. Furthermore, projections of
responses onto the total response are simply the individual modal
contribution to the total response at a degree-of-freedom. Thus, the only
items available for output are the individual modal response magnitude
(PROJECTION), the modal fraction (FRACTION), and the scaled response
magnitude (SCALED). Selection of any of the other items from the itemlist
table causes selection of the modal response magnitude (PROJECTION)
item.

1. This command can be illustrated by an example. Suppose stress output is
desired for the first five modes only and displacements for the next two
modes and forces for the remaining modes. The following example would
accomplish this

2. This command causes the results for each mode to be considered as a
separate, successively numbered subcase, beginning with the subcase
number containing the MODES command. In the example above, this means
that subcases 1, 2, 3, etc. are assigned to modes 1, 2, 3, etc., respectively.
3. If this command is not used, eigenvalue results are considered to be a part of
a single subcase. Therefore, any output requests for the single subcase will

4. It should be noted that the computed modes used for mode selection include
the augmented modes (if any) resulting from residual vector calculations.
5. If LMODENM is specified without HMODENM, a default value of 10000000
(ten million) is assumed for HMODENM. If HMODENM is specified
without LMODENM, a default value of 1 is assumed for LMODENM.
6. If LFREQ is specified without HFREQ, a default value of 1.0E+30 is assumed
for HFREQ. If HFREQ is specified without LFREQ, a default value of 0.0 is
assumed for LFREQ.
7. If the format involving the MEFFMFRA criteria is employed, it is not
necessary for the user to specify a MEFFMASS command in Case Control or,
even if such a command is specified, to explicitly request the calculation of
the modal effective mass fractions. In the absence of such a command or
such a request, the program will automatically perform the necessary
calculations internally to ensure that the required modal effective mass
fractions are computed.
8. If the T1FR / R1FR / ALLFR keywords are specified without the
corresponding tifr / r1fr / allfr threshold values, then a default value of 0.95
(that is, 95%) is assumed for these threshold values if the selection criterion
is SUM and a default value of 0.05 (that is, 5%) is assumed if the selection
criterion is ANYMIN or ALLMIN.
9. The modal effective mass for a given mode is a measure of how much mass
is associated with that mode and indicates the sensitivity of that mode to
base excitation. Modal effective mass is meaningful only for fixed base
modes. If a structure is not restrained, all the modal effective mass will be
associated with its rigid body modes.
10. When the MODESELECT Case Control command is used in conjunction
with the parameters LMODES/LMODESFL, LFREQ/LFREQFL and
HFREQ/HFREQFL, the hierarchy of their usage is as follows:
(a)

If there is a MODESELECT Case Control command, it takes
precedence over the parameters LMODES/LMODESFL,
LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL. (It does not matter
whether these parameters are defined directly via PARAM entries or
indirectly via the FLSFSEL Case Control command.)

(b)

If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command, then parameter
LMODES/LMODESFL takes precedence over the parameters
LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL. In this case, the number
of lowest modes specified by LMODES/LMODESFL will be
included in the modal dynamic analysis.

If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command and no

LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL are honored. In this case,
all of the computed modes whose frequencies are in the range
specified by LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL will be
included in the modal dynamic analysis.
If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command and no
LMODES/LMODESFL, LFREQ/LFREQFL or HFREQ/HFREQFL
parameter, then all of the computed modes will be included in the
modal dynamic analysis.

11. If a subset of the computed modes is selected for subsequent use in the modal
dynamic analysis, the user is informed of this via an user information
message. Further, in this case, a new eigenvalue table indicating the actual
modes selected for the analysis is output. In addition, if the user has
employed a MODESELECT command involving the MEFFMFRA criteria,
the modal effective mass fractions for the selected modes are also output.
12. If the mode selection criterion results in no modes being selected for
subsequent use in the modal dynamic analysis, the program terminates the
job with a fatal message indicating that no modal formulation is possible.
13. If the use of the MODESELECT command results in the selection of all of the
computed modes for subsequent use, the user is informed of this via an user
information message.
14. The following examples illustrate the usage of the various formats of the
MODESELECT command described above.

OMODES Case Control command allows for an alternate way of selecting
the modes to be output based on their mode numbers. In these cases, if both
the OMODES and OFREQUENCY requests appear, the OMODES request
takes precedence.
2. If this command is not specified in the Case Control Section (or, in the case
of real eigenvalue, buckling, and complex eigenvalue analyses, if neither the
OMODES nor the OFREQUENCY request is specified), then output will be
generated for all frequencies.
3. The number of solutions selected will always be equal to the number of
quantities in the selected set. The closest values are used.
4. In flutter analysis (SOL 145), the selected set refers to the imaginary part of
the complex eigenvalues. The physical interpretation of this quantity
depends on the method of flutter analysis as follows:

• K- or KE-method: Velocity (input units).

8

6. In complex eigenvalue analysis (SOLs 107, and 110), the selected set refers to
the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues.
7. If this command is specified in more than one subcase, then it is
recommended that the first subcase contain OFREQ=ALL and subsequent
subcases contain OFREQ=n. Also, data recovery requests should be specified

Transmitted loads can be obtained with GPFORCE requests.

• In the nonlinear transient analysis solution sequences SOLs 129 and

7. Loads generated via the SPCD Bulk Data entry do not appear in OLOAD
output.
8. In SORT1 format, OLOADs recovered at consecutively numbered scalar
points are printed in groups of six (sextets) per line of output. But if a scalar
point is not consecutively numbered, then it will begin a new sextet on a new
line of output. If a sextet can be formed and it is zero, then the line will not
be printed. If a sextet cannot be formed, then zero values may be output.
9. OLOAD results are output in the global coordinate system (see field CD on
the GRID Bulk Data entry).
10. In static inertia relief analysis the OLOAD output includes both the inertia
loads and applied loads.
11. The option of PSDF, ATOC, CRMS and RALL, or any combination of them,
can be selected for random analysis. The results can be either printed in the

It is ignored in all other analyses.
2. In contrast to the OFREQENCY Case Control request, which affords an
alternate way of selecting the modes to be output based on their frequencies,
the OMODES command allows mode selection based on integer mode ID.

the number of modes computed. Instead, it only provides a means for
selecting a subset of the computed modes for which output is to be
generated.
6. In superelement analysis, the set definition of an OMODES request for an
upstream superelement will not be honored unless a similar request appears
for its downstream neighbor. The downstream request should either be
comprised of the union of all upstream requests, or left blank, as the
OMODES default is ALL. Note that the code does not check to see if this

2. The TOFILE describer is followed by the specification of either a FORTRAN
unit reference number or a file name associated with the external file that
receives the output data. If a FORTRAN unit number is used, the file must
be associated with it via the ASSIGN File Management Statement. If POST
appears above all subcases, TOFILE must be used to specify either a
FORTRAN unit reference number or a file name. The default value of
TOFILE, which appears under a subcase, will inherit from the value given in
the POST above all subcases. If the unit reference number is associated with
a form=formatted file, changes in unit numbers across subcases are not
allowed.
3. The data that can be controlled for each post-processor product is limited
and is identified under the description of the POST and related DMAP
parameters in “Parameters” on page 603. The keywords that can be used for
the oplist options are shown in the following table. If an output item
supported by a particular post-processor is described in “Parameters” on
page 603 but is not listed here, then the POST command cannot be used to
control its output to the external file.

----------------

4. Output data items must have been generated via the appropriate case control
command in order for the data to be available for post-processing options.
For example, the specification of SPCF in the oplist of the POST command
will not produce forces of single point constraint on the POST output file
unless there is a SPCF Case Control command present. Refer to the tables
under the POST parameter description in “Parameters” on page 603 for a list
of the output items supported by each post-processor.
5. Any data generated by a case control output request is automatically
included in the oplist of the POST command. If output data is not wanted for
a particular case, then the characters “NO” should be the first two characters
of the keyword in the oplist. For example, NODISP specifies that
displacements are not to be posted to the output file even though they have
been requested via the DISP Case Control command. Alternatively, the
related POST parameters may be used. For example, to avoid outputting any
displacements whatsoever to the .op2 file, use a “PARAM, OUG, NO” Bulk
Data entry.
6. Certain data (e.g. geometry) is always generated and is not dependent upon
the presence of a case control command in the input data. The POST
command affects the placement of this data on the external file only insofar
as the selection of the post-processor defines the value of the POST DMAP
parameter value. The actions described in “Parameters” on page 603 under

the POST parameter description will prevail for the particular value of POST
associated with the selected post-processor. The primary purpose of the
POST command is to give the user more control over subcase-dependent
output data being stored on the external OUTPUT2 file.
7. If a POST command is present within any subcase, a POST command must
also be present above the subcase level. The placement of the POST
command above the subcase level causes a cumulative effect on POST
commands in subsequent subcases. Any options specified above the subcase
level propagate down into the POST command within a subsequent subcase.
Thus, if a POST command specifies NODISP (no displacement output
wanted) above the subcase level, then a POST command with the DISP
option would be required within a subcase to generate any output to the
OUTPUT2 file for displacements. This also implies that changing the
OUTPUT2 file unit reference number with the TOFILE option in a subcase
causes all output quantities currently scheduled for output to be switched to
the new unit number, not just those in the oplist for the current POST
command.
8. When the name of an output file is specified by keyword TOFILE, the
ASSIGN statement in the File Management Section (FMS) can be used to
specify the full path of its root name. the logical-key word for the root name
is OUTPUT2F. The default root name is the MSC.Nastran job name.
FORTRAN unit reference number 19 has been reserved by MSC.Nastran for
OUTPUT2F, although the user can assign other FORTRAN unit number to
it. The full file name is in the form of <root name>.<suffix filename>.
9. When the name of an output file is specified by keyword TOCASE, the
ASSIGN statement in the File Management Section (FMS) can be used to
specify the full path of its root name. the logical-key word for the root name
is OPCASE. The default root name is the MSC.Nastran job name. FORTRAN
unit reference number 22 has been reserved by MSC.Nastran for OPCASE.
Although the user can assign other .FORTRAN unit numbers to it. The full
file name is in the form of <root name>.<suffix filename>. Also ppname and
oplist are not required. If ppname and oplist are specified, they will be
ignored. Suffix filename must be specified with keyword TOCASE.

7. For the LINEAR method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom are eliminated
and placed in the mp-set. For the LAGRAN method, both independent and
dependent degrees-of-freedoms are placed in l-set. Lagrange multiplier
degrees-of-freedoms are created internally for the dependent degrees-offreedom and placed in l-set. For the LGELIM method, first the LAGRAN
rigid elements are created. Then both the Lagrange degrees-of-freedom and
the dependent degrees-of-freedom are eliminated, and the dependent
degrees-of-freedom are placed in the mr-set. Both mp-set and mr-set are
subset of m-set. Please see “Degree-of-Freedom Set Definitions” on
page 846.
8. Between LAGRAN and LGELIM, LAGRAN is the preferred method.
LGELIM is a backup method if difficulty is encountered using the LAGRAN
method.

Remarks:
1. STATSUB may be used in SOLs 103, 105, 107 through 112, and SOL 200

2. STATSUB must be specified in the same subcase that contains the METHOD
selection for buckling or normal modes, CMETHOD for complex eigenvalue
analysis, TSTEP for transient response and FREQ for frequency response.
3. In SOL 105, if it is intended that results from the first static subcase are used
to compute the differential stiffness, then the STATSUB command is not
required. In other words, the default for STATSUB is the first static subcase
identification. In SOLs 103 and 107 through 112, 115, and 116, STATSUB
must reference a separate static subcase.
4. In dynamic analysis only one STATSUB command may be specified in each
dynamic subcase. In buckling analysis with a pre-load, both STATSUB

5. STRESS=NONE overrides an overall output request.
6. The PLOT option is used when contour plots of stresses are requested but no
printer output of stresses is desired. However in nonlinear analysis, the
nonlinear stresses will still be printed unless NLSTRESS(PLOT) is specified.
7. The VONMISES option is ignored for ply stresses.
8. The VONMISES, MAXS, and SHEAR options are ignored in the complex
eigenvalue and frequency response solution sequences.
9. The options CENTER, CORNER, CUBIC, SGAGE, and BILIN are recognized
only in the first subcase and determine the option to be used in all
subsequent subcases with the STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands. (In
superelement analysis, the first subcase refers to the first subcase of each
superelement. Therefore, it is recommended that these options be specified
above all subcases.) Consequently, options specified in subcases other than
the first subcase will be ignored. See also Remark 8 under the “FORCE” on

Remarks:
1. The STRFIELD command is required for the graphical display of grid point
stresses in postprocessors that use the .xdb file (PARAM,POST,0), or when
the GPSDCON or ELSDCON commands are specified, and does not provide
printed output. The GPSTRESS command can be used to obtain printed
output.
2. Only grid points connected to elements used to define the surface or volume
are output. See the SURFACE and VOLUME commands.
3. Element stress output (STRESS) must be requested for elements referenced
on requested SURFACE and VOLUME commands.
4. In nonlinear static and transient analysis, grid point stresses are computed
only if parameter LGDISP is -1, which is the default. Also, in nonlinear
transient analysis, grid point stresses are computed for elements with linear
material properties only.

TEMPERATURE(INITIAL). The following rules apply

• The specification of TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) is required above the

subcase level. The specification of TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) or
TEMPERATURE(BOTH) will cause a fatal error.

• If a subcase does not contain a TEMPERATURE(LOAD) request, then

• If TREF and TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) are specified, then the

OUTPUT(PLOT) Commands
The PLOT command requests the generation of undeformed, deformed, or contour
plots. All other commands specify how the model will be plotted, type of projection,
view angles, scales, etc. All commands have default actions if not specified by the user.
The FIND command may be used to calculate an optimal SCALE, ORIGIN, and/or
VANTAGE POINT to allow the construction of a plot in a user-specified region of the
paper or film. All the commands used in the generation of the various plots will be
printed out as part of the output, whether they are directly specified, defaulted or
established using the FIND command. Initialization of commands to default values
occurs only once. Subsequently, these values remain until altered by direct command
input. The only exceptions are the view angles, scale factors, vantage points, and the
origins. Whenever the plotter or the method of projection is changed, the view angles
are reset to the default values, unless they are respecified by the user. In addition, the
scale factors, vantage points, and the origin must be respecified by the user.
The commands are listed here in a logical sequence; however, they need not be so
specified. Any order may be used, but if a command is specified more than once, the
value or choice stated last will be used.

OUTPUT

4C

PLOTTER

VANTAGE
POINT

Defines the location of the observer with respect to the model in
the (r, s, t) coordinate system defined on the AXES command
for perspective and stereoscopic projections only.

PROJECTION
PLANE

Defines the separation, along the r-axis, between the observer
and the projection plane if not already specified on the
VANTAGE POINT command. Used by stereoscopic projections
only.

OCULAR
SEPARATION

Defines the separation of the left and right eye vantage points
along the s-axis for stereoscopic projections.

CAMERA

Specifies microfilm plotter options.

PAPER SIZE

Defines the size and type of the paper.

PEN

Generates a message on the printed output to inform the plotter
operator as to what size and color pen point to mount in the
various pen holders.

PTITLE

Defines a character string that will appear at the top of the plot
frame on the line below the sequence number.

SET

Defines a set of elements and/or grid points to be plotted.

FIND

Requests the plotter to optimally compute any of the
parameters that can be specified on the SCALE, ORIGIN i,
and/or VANTAGE POINT commands.

CONTOUR

Specifies contour plot options for stress, displacement, or
temperature.

PLOT

Generates an undeformed plot or a deformed plot per subcase,
mode number, frequency, or time step. A contour plot may also
be requested with an undeformed or deformed plot.

BULK

1. If no AXES command is specified then AXES X, Y, Z is the default.
2. The direction of view is in the negative r-direction; i.e., the projection plane
is parallel to the s-t plane.
3. The VIEW command depends on the AXES command specification and
defines the angular relationship between observer’s coordinate system and
the basic coordinate system.

AXES

487

Orientation of Observer’s Coordinate System

4. The AXES command can be used to preposition the object in 90° increments
in such a manner that only rotations less than 90° are required by the VIEW
command to obtain the desired orientation. MX, MY, MZ can be used to
define left-handed coordinate systems. Note that the default system is
right-handed.
5. An undeformed or deformed plot of the symmetric portion of an object can
be obtained by reversing the sign of the axis that is normal to the plane of
symmetry. In the case of multiple planes of symmetry, the signs of all
associated planes should be reversed. The ANTISYMMETRIC option should
be specified when a symmetric model is loaded in an unsymmetric manner.
This will cause the deformations to be plotted antisymmetrically with
respect to the specified plane or planes. Since the AXES command applies to
all parts (SETs) of a single frame, symmetric and antisymmetric
combinations cannot be made with this command (see the symmetry option
on the “PLOT” on page 503 command in this section).
6. To avoid a mirror image, ensure that the r, s, and t axes obey the right-hand
rule.

2. If FILM or BOTH is specified then these options must be communicated to
the plotter operator through normal means of communications at the
installation.
3. If FILM or BOTH are specified and if n is greater than 0 then n blank frames
will be inserted between plots. The plotter must be operated in the manual
mode in order to have blank frames inserted between positive prints. If blank
frames are desired only on film, and not on paper, the plotter must be
operated in the automatic mode.

Scale factor applied to characters in the plot frame. (Default = .5)

Remarks:
1. CSCALE is used to control the spacing of characters when plots are made
with the NASTRAN plotter and they are postprocessed with the
MSC/NASPLOT routine. For example, if the SCALE FACTOR on the
NASPLOT data command is 2.0, a value for cs of 0.5 will result in characters
of default size (.07 inches) at the regular spacing. A value of 1.8 produces
good spacing when using the post-processing plotter programs NASTPLT,
TEKPLT, and NEUPS. On the other hand, if the user wishes to double the
size of both the plot and the characters, the SCALE FACTOR and the
CSCALE FACTOR on the NASPLOT data command should both be set
equal to 2.0.
2. The CSCALE command must immediately precede the PLOTTER
command. If a second CSCALE command is specified then a second
PLOTTER command must also be specified.

the undeformed shape using the same sets, PEN 1 or DENSITY 1, and
symbol 2 (if SYMBOLS is specified). If SHAPE and VECTOR are specified,
the underlay will depend on whether “0" is used along with the subcases
with DEFORMATION. It will be the deformed shape when not used and will
be both deformed and undeformed shapes when it is used. The part of the
vector at the grid point will be the tail when the underlay is undeformed and
the head when it is deformed. If the v=“N” then no shape will be drawn but
other options such as SYMBOLS will still be valid.

3. For stereoscopic projections, the stereoscopic effect is enhanced by first
reducing the real object to a smaller model according to b, and then applying
a. The ratio of plotted/real object is then the product of a and b.

X-Y PLOT Commands
The X-Y output request packet of the Case Control Section includes all commands
between either OUTPUT(XYPLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT) and either BEGIN BULK or
or OUTPUT(PLOT). The remainder of this section describes the X-Y output
commands.
A single set of plotted X-Y pairs is known as a curve. Curves are the entities that the
user requests to be plotted. The surface (paper, microfilm frame, etc.) on which one or
more curves is plotted is known as a frame. Curves may be plotted on a whole frame,
an upper-half frame, or a lower-half frame. Grid lines, tic marks, axes, axis labeling
and other graphic control options may be chosen by the user. The program will select
defaults for parameters not selected by the user.
Only two commands are required for an X-Y output request.

PARAM

1. Only one of OUTPUT(XYPLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT) at the beginning of
the X-Y output command packet.
2. At least one of the commands XYPLOT, XYPEAK, XYPRINT, XYPUNCH,
XYPAPLOT
The commands OUTPUT(XYPLOT) and OUTPUT(XYOUT) are equivalent. If the X-Y
output is to be printed and/or punched, a PLOTTER command is not required.
If only the required commands are used, the graphic control options will all assume
default values. Curves using all default parameters have the following general
characteristics.
1. Tic marks are drawn on all edges of the frame. Five spaces are provided on
each edge of the frame.
2. All tic marks are labeled with their values.

6
CODES

3. Linear scales are used.
4. Scales are selected such that all points fall within the frame.
5. The plotter points are connected with straight lines.

7
SETS

8
BULK

6. The plotted points are not identified with symbols.
The above characteristics may be modified by inserting any of the parameter
definition commands in the next section, ahead of the XY____ command(s). The use of
a parameter definition command sets the value of that parameter for all following
command operation commands unless the CLEAR command is inserted. If grid lines
are requested, they will be drawn at the locations of all tic marks that result from
defaults or user request. The locations of tic marks (or grid lines) for logarithmic scales

527

cannot be selected by the user. Values for logarithmic spacing are selected by the
program. The values for the number of tic marks (or grid lines) per cycle depend on
the number of logarithmic cycles required for the range of the plotted values.
The definition and rules for the X-Y output commands follow. The form of X-Y output
commands differ in many instances from that of similar commands used in the
OUTPUT(PLOT) section.

-1

Draw tic marks only.

0

Do not draw tic marks or associated values. (Default)

1

Draw tic marks and associated values.

Remarks:
1. ALLEDGE TICS applies to whole frame curves only.
2. To determine if on any given edge (a) tic marks will be drawn without
values, (b) no tic marks or values will be drawn, or (c) tic marks with values
will be drawn, the following sum must be computed by the user. Add the tic
values of the edge in question to its associated ALLEDGE TICS, TALL EDGE
TICS, or BALL EDGE TICS tic values. If the resulting value is less than zero,
tic marks will be drawn without values. If the resulting value is zero, no tic
marks or values will be drawn. If the resulting value is greater than zero, tic
marks with values will be drawn. The user should be careful in his use of the
ALLEDGE TICS, TALL EDGE TICS, or BALL EDGE TICS commands. For
example, the use of only the ALLEDGE TICS = -1 command will result in no
tic marks or values being drawn since the default values for individual edges
is +1. Tic values input may only be -1, 0, or 1.

Example 1:
OUTPUT (XYPLOT)
CSCALE = 1.8
XYPLOT SDISP/16(T1)
BEGIN BULK
This sequence causes a single whole frame to be plotted for the T1 displacement
component of solution set point 16 using the default parameter values. If 16(T1) is not
in the solution set, a warning message will be printed and no plot will be made. The
plot will be generated for the NASTRAN plotter on file PLT which must be available.
Example 2:
OUTPUT (XYOUT)
CSCALE = 1.8
XYPLOT, XYPRINT VELO RESPONSE 1,5 /3(R1,), 5(,R1)
OUTPUT (PLOT)
This sequence causes two frame plots (each consisting of an upper half frame and a
lower half frame) to be plotted, one for subcase 1 and one for subcase 5, using the
default parameter values. The velocity of the first rotational component of grid point
3 will be plotted on the upper half frame and that of grid point 5 will be plotted on the
lower half frame. Tabular printer output will also be generated for both curves.

This sequence is an example of plotting in a Flutter Analysis for which a split frame
plot will be made; the upper half is V-g and the lower half is V-f. Data from the first
four loops will be plotted. Distinct symbols are used for data from each loop and no
lines are drawn between points (since the flutter analyst must sometimes exercise
judgement about which points should be connected). The plots will also be printed in
the normal output. These plots will not have all the features of the external plots, but
can be very useful in getting a quick picture of the curves.

For elements the code represents a component of the element
stress, strain, or force and are described in Table 6-1 and
Table 6-2 of the Guide. For ptype=“AUTO”and “PSDF”, the
complex stress or strain item codes need to be used. As the
output quantities are real, you can use either the real or the
imaginary item code. Both will give the same result.
For grid points and pty=“RESPONSE”, the code is one of the
mnemonics T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, R3, T1RM, T2RM, T3RM,
R1RM, R2RM, R3RM, T1IP, T2IP, T3IP, R1IP, R2IP, or R3IP,
where Ti stands for the i-th translational component, Ri
stands for the i-th rotational component, RM means real or
magnitude, and IP means imaginary or phase. For scalar or
extra points or heat transfer analysis, use T1, T1RM, or T1IP.
For grid points and ptype=“AUTO” or “PSDF”, the code is
one of the mnemonics T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, R3. For scalar or
extra points use T1.
For yvtype=VG, itemui and/or or itemli can be “F” for
frequency or “G” for damping.

Generate X-Y Plots for a Plotter

Remarks:
1. Multiple XYPLOT, XYPUNCH, XYPRINT, XYPEAK and/or XYPAPLOT
commands may be specified in the OUTPUT(XYPLOT) section.
2. Solution set requests are more efficient, because the time-consuming
recovery of the dependent displacements can be avoided.
3. The item codes also appear in printed summaries as “CURVE ID” for grid
points as well as element data.
4. The information after each slash ( / ) specifies the curve(s) that are to be
plotted on the same frame. The describer idij identifies the grid point j or
element j associated with the frame number i. All plot requests on one
command are sorted on idij to improve the efficiency of the plotting process.
Symbols are assigned in order by idij.
5. If any of the item codes, itemlij or itemuij, are not specified; e.g., (8,) or (,5),
the corresponding half frame curve is not plotted. If both the comma ( , ) and
itemlij not specified; e.g., (8), then whole frame curves will be plotted. Also,
for any single frame, the specifications of “(itemuij,itemlij)” must be
consistently half frame (upper and/or lower) or whole frame. For example
on half frame curves, if iteml11 and the comma is not specified then either
iteml12 or itemu12 must not be specified and on whole frame curves, the
commas, iteml11, and iteml12 must not be specified. In other words, the
curves on each plot frame must be all whole or half (upper and/or lower).
6. The XYPLOT command may be continued on the next line as long as
“XYPLOT yvtype ptype [ i1, i2, i3,... ] /” is specified on the first line.
7. Specifying a nonexistent grid point may cause the program to exit in the
XYTRAN module and missing plots to occur.
8. mode_id is used for natural frequency selection of Oxx2m participation
versus excitation frequency output.
frequency_id is used for excitation frequency selection of Oxx2E
participation versus natural frequency output. frequency_id is an integer
value; e.g., (2) would represent the second frequency calculated.

Parameter Descriptions
Parameters are used extensively in the solution sequences for input of scalar values
and for requesting special features. Parameters values are specified on PARAM Bulk
Data entries or PARAM Case Control commands. The PARAM Bulk Data entry is
described in the “Bulk Data Entries” on page 851. The PARAM Case Control
command is described in the “Case Control Commands” on page 177. A complete
alphabetical list of PARAMeter names and their functions is given in this section.
ACOUT

Default=PEAK
ACOUT specifies the type of output to be used with the FORCE Case
Control command in coupled fluid-structural analysis (see
“Additional Topics” on page 555 of the MSC.Nastran Reference
Guide. ACOUT=RMS requests root-mean-square output.

3
EXEC

To obtain sound pressure level in units of dB and dBA given by the
FORCE command, a peak reference pressure must be specified with
PARAM, PREFDB. The dB level is defined as:

See also the Case Control command “FLSTCNT” on page 276.
ACSYM

5

By default, the dynamic equations for coupled fluid-structure
analysis in frequency response are symmetrized for efficiency.
PARAM,ACSYM,NO requests the pre-Version 69 formulation which
involves no symmetrization and will require more CPU time. See
“Formulation of Dynamic Equations in SubDMAP GMA” on
page 429 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide. See also the Case
Control command “FLSTCNT” on page 276.

PARAM

6
CODES

If the iterative solver is selected (see the ITER=YES keyword on the
NASTRAN statement) then the external work diagnostic will be
different between ACSYM=YES and ACSYM=NO.

7
SETS

ADJMETH

8
BULK

Default=YES

Default = 0
This parameter selects the processing method used in a triple matrix
product in module DSADJ. The default is usually preferred, but
ADJMETH=1 can be used when disk space is critical. ADJMETH=2
only holds the active solution vectors.

Parameters

605

ADPCON

ADPCON

Default=1.0
Initial penalty values used in contact analysis are calculated
automatically by the program and are given by
k ⋅ SFAC ⋅ ADPCON where k is a number selected for each slave
node based on the diagonal stiffness matrix coefficients that are in
the contact region, and SFAC is the value specified by the user in the
SFAC field of the BCONP Bulk Data entry. The ADPCON value
applies to all the contact regions in the model. During the analysis,
if convergence problems are encountered, penalty values are
automatically reduced. Still there may be some problems where
convergence can not be achieved with default values. In such cases,
analysis may be restarted with a lower value of ADPCON.
In some cases the default penalty values may be low. In such
situations analysis may be restarted with a higher value of
ADPCON.
Generally, penalty values are recalculated every time there is a
change in stiffness. However, if ADPCON is negative, penalty
values are calculated only at the beginning of each subcase, and
penalty values are not adjusted during analysis. This is useful if the
contact between two elastic bodies is being analyzed.

1. The calculation of component modes is attempted on all
superelements including the residual structure.
2. All component modes are treated like SPOINTs which
means that all component modes are “brought down” to

words, component modes may not be assigned interior to a
superelement.
3. Selected component modes may not be removed
(constrained).

AUTOSPCR

Default=NO (SOLs 106 and 153 only)
In nonlinear static analysis only, AUTOSPCR specifies the action to
take when singularities exist in linear stiffness matrix of the residual
structure after multipoint constraints are processed.
AUTOSPCR=YES means that singularities will be constrained and
AUTOSPCR=NO means they will not be constrained. It is
recommended that all degrees-of-freedom attached to nonlinear
elements be specified on ASETi entries. Parameters EPPRT,
EPZERO, PRGPST, and SPCGEN may be used with AUTOSPCR.

AUTOSPRT

Default = YES
By default, free-free models will be automatically constrained for
calculation of residual vectors (RESVEC Case Control command) as
long as F1<=0.0 on the EIGR (or EIGRL) Bulk Data entry. The autoSUPORT method may be deactivated by specifying a SUPORTi
entry, PARAM,AUTOSPRT,NO, or F1>0.0.
FZERO is the maximum frequency assumed for a rigid body mode.
FZERO is used by the auto-SUPORT method to extract the rigid body
frequencies. The default is 1.0E-4.

reference axis of the material coordinate system is used to
transform the stress and/or strain data into the material
coordinate system at the element centers.
2. If, on the other hand, the user requests these data at the grid
points to which the elements connect the program will
interpolate the results from (a) to the grid points to which
the elements connect. The parameter NlNTPTS=N, the
stress and/or strain data at the N closest element centers to

Default=DBALL
By default, all data to be stored on the database for restart purposes
will be located on the DBALL database set DBset). These parameters
permit the storage of some data blocks on DBsets other than DBALL,
which are defined by the user and specified on the INIT File
Management statement. Any or all of these parameters may be set to
SCRATCH in order to reduce overall disk space usage; e.g.,
PARAM,DBUP,SCRATCH or PARAM,DBALL,SCRATCH.
However, automatic restarts will be less efficient because data
normally assigned to a permanent DBset will have to be recomputed.
A unique value for each superelement may be specified in the Case
Control Section for the parameters DBALL, DBDN, DBRCV, and
DBUP. Certain DBsets may be taken offline depending on which
phase (see “Summary of Solution Sequence Operations” on
page 441 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide) of superelement
analysis is being performed. PARAM,DBALL specifies the default
value for parameters DBDN, DBUP, and DBRCV.
The DBDN DBset contains data blocks necessary for “downstream”
processing. For example, the stiffness, mass, damping, and static
loads matrices that have been reduced to the boundary of the
superelement are stored in this DBset.
The DBRCV DBset contains data blocks that must be online during
the first pass through data recovery (Phase 3). These data blocks are
used to recover the total displacement vector ug of the superelement.
This operation is performed by the SSG3 and SDR1 modules. On
subsequent data recovery restarts, this DBset may be taken offline.

values on the DESVAR entry (through DVCRELi, DVMRELi,
DVPRELi relations) is greater than DPEPS, the design model values
override the analysis values. If all the differences are less than
DPEPS, analysis results from a previous run are accepted in a
subsequent sensitivity/optimization task, thereby avoiding a
reanalysis. The PTOL parameter on the DOPTPRM entry is a related
parameter that checks the maximum difference.

DPHFLG

Default = 0
In eigenvector sensitivity analysis DPHFLG=1 selects the subspace
iteration method, which can accommodate repeated roots. Unless
repeated eigenvalues are anticipated, the default value is
recommended.

DSNOKD

Default = 0.0
DSNOKD specifies a scale factor to the differential stiffness matrix in
buckling design sensitivity analysis. If DSNOKD > 0.0, the effect of
the differential stiffness matrix is included in buckling the design
sensitivity analysis.
If PARAM,DSNOKD > 0 is specified in SOL 105, under the original
Design Sensitivity Analysis (DSA), the differential stiffness
sensitivity calculation is performed under the assumption that all the
displacements are enforced; i.e., the change in the stiffness matrix
due to the changes in the displacements are not computed.
Therefore, PARAM,DSNOKD,0.0 is recommended in SOL 105. If
PARAM,DSNOKD,1.0 is specified in SOL 200, the differential
stiffness sensitivity calculation is performed more accurately; i.e., the
change in the stiffness matrix due to the changes in the
displacements are computed. However, the calculation is more
expensive than with PARAM,DSNOKD,0.0.
Non-zero values of PARAM,DSNOKD cannot be used in SOL 200

Default = ABS
This parameter is designed for use with the SPC/SPCD method of
enforced motion specification in SOLs 108, 109, 111, 112, 146, and

represent absolute motion of the model. If the value is specified as
REL, then the results represent motion relative to the enforced
motion of the base. In the case of modal dynamic analysis (SOL 111
and SOL 112), this latter scenario is equivalent to employing the
large mass approach and excluding the rigid body modes from the

641

EXTOUT

EXTOUT

When inputting the matrices for a reduced external superelement
(SEBULK, CSUPER), there are four options that can be selected using
the parameter EXTOUT. EXTOUT must be placed in the Case
Control Section above any subcase or in the main Bulk Data Section.
The options for Step 1 (see the table at the end of this discussion) are
as follows:

nastran

If EXTOUT is set to MATRIXDB, the reduced structural matrices and
loading are stored on the database.

FMS

If EXTOUT is set to DMIGDB, the reduced structural matrices and
loading are stored on the database in a format which allows
automatic connection to the analysis model if the identification
numbers of the reduction grid points and scalar points are the same
as the grid points and scalar points used in the analysis model.
If EXTOUT is set to DMIGOP2, the reduced structural matrices and
loading are written in OUTPUT2 format to a tape unit specified by
the parameter EXTUNIT (Default30). The storage format is the same
as the DMIGDB option and allows automatic connection to the
analysis model if the identification numbers of the reduction grid
points and scalar points are the same as the grid points and scalar
points used in the analysis model. The output unit can be assigned
to a specific file by using an ASSIGN command in the File
Management Section.
If EXTOUT is set to DMIGPCH, the reduced structural matrices and
loading are output on the punch file (.pch) in DMIG format.
The procedure for accessing the external superelement information
depends on the option used to output the external superelement in
Step 1. The methods are as follows:
1. If EXTOUT was MATRIXDB or DMIGDB in Step 1, use the
following commands in the File Management Section:

If data recovery is desired for the external component in SOLs 101,
103, and 107 through 112, there are three methods to transmit the
displacements of the reduced model to the external full model. The
method is selected by the parameter EXTDROUT in the partitioned
Bulk Data Section. The options are as follows:
1. EXTDROUT set to MATRIXDB. The displacements of the
reduced component model are stored directly on the
database. The sequencing of the displacement degrees-offreedom corresponds to the sequencing in the reduced
model.
2. EXTDROUT set to DMIGDB. The displacements of the
reduced model are stored on the database in a format which
allows automatic connection to the reduced component
model if the reduction grid points and scalar points are the
same grid points and scalar points used in the analysis
model. This option can only be used if EXTOUT was set to
DMIGDB or DMIGOP2.

Parameters

643

EXTOUT

3. EXTDROUT set to DMIGOP2. The same as EXTDROUT set
to DMIGDB except that the displacements of the reduced
model are written in OUTPUT2 format to a tape unit
specified by parameter EXTDRUNT (default=31). The
output unit can be assigned to a specific file by using an
ASSIGN command in the File Management Section. This
option can only be used if EXTOUT was set to DMIGDB or
DMIGOP2.
Data recovery for the external component is limited to SOLs 101 and
103 and 107 through 112. Data recovery is accomplished using a
restart procedure from the data base created in step one and setting
parameter EXTDR to YES. The method on inputting the reduced
displacements into the component model depends on the method
used to output the external component in Step 2. The input methods
are as follows:
1. If EXTDROUT was MATRIXDB or DMIGDB in Step 2, then
add the following commands in the File Management

FIXEDB

Default=0
FIXEDB is used to reduce the cost of superelement checkout.
FIXEDB = -2 (SOL 101 only) is used on the initial runs when the user
suspects that the superelement may contain errors and that only
operations necessary for fixed-boundary solutions need be
performed. In particular, the generation of the [ G oa ] matrix is
branched over in the SEKR operation and [ P a ] is not generated in
the SELR operation. These operations typically result in 50% of the
reduction cost and are not needed in the fixed-boundary data
recovery operations described in the next paragraph. After this
operation has been completed, the keyword SELANG will appear in
the database dictionary, indicating that the [ P a ] stored there is
incomplete, and should not be summed into the downstream
superelement, because System Fatal Message 4252 will be issued.

Parameters

647

FKSYMFAC

FlXEDB < -1 (SOLs 101 and 103 only) allows uncoupled solutions for
any superelement with conventional output requests. This output
may be obtained as soon as the superelement is successfully
generated and reduced and does not require that the entire model be
assembled. In superelement statics, the solution is the component
due to the
{ u oo }
vector, i.e., a fixed-boundary solution. In superelement modes, the
solution is the uncoupled eigenvectors of the component. If
PARAM,FIXEDB,-1 is specified in the Bulk Data or in the residual
structure subcase, the modes of the residual structure will not be
computed. For a printout or plotting of the component mode
eigenvectors it is recommended that PARAM,FIXEDB,-1 be specified
in the Bulk Data Section or above the subcase level in Case Control.
If the modes of the residual structure are desired, then
PARAM,FlXEDB,0 should be specified in the residual structure
subcase. Exterior degrees-of-freedom listed on SECSETi and SESUP
entries are free, and those on SEBSETi degrees-of-freedom are fixed.
Data recovery for the residual structure should not be requested for
this option.
FlXEDB = +1 (SOL 101 only) is used after the superelement has been
proven valid. In the SEKR and SELR operations, it provides a branch
over all operations already completed in the SEKR and SELR phases
and completes the generation of the [ G oa ] matrix and the boundary
stiffness and load matrices. It is also a method to recover the factor
of the [ K oo ] matrix if the run aborted while computing [ G oa ] .

LMODES,

LMFACT and PENFN are the scale factor and penalty function for

PENFN is to make the values of stiffness matrix of the Lagrange
rigid elements about the same relative magnitude as those of the
other elements in the model. Too small a value will produce
inaccurate results and too large a value will produce numerical
difficulties. The same value is usually assigned to both LMFACT
and PENFN. Under special requirement, user may assign different
values for LMFACT and PENFN. For example, if PENFN=0.0 and
LMFACT ≠ 0.0 , then the solution method for the rigid elements
become the pure Lagrange multiplier method instead of the
augmented Lagrangian method. However, user must exercise
caution if different values are assigned to LMFACT and PENFN.
The default value is 1.0e+5 for all solution sequences except SOL 400.

MARCGAUS

MARCGAUS

Integer, Default = 1, MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600)
only
MARCGAUS=1, MSC.Marc output stresses and strains will be at
the Gauss points for solid elements and at the center (top and
bottom surfaces) for plates/shells (average of 4 Gauss point
stresses). This option produces the best stresses; however,
plate/shell stress contours may be too low when plotted using op2
data versus t16/t19 data because of the averaging at the Gauss
points. MSC.Nastran presently has no Gauss stress outputs for
plate/shell elements whereas MSC.Marc’s t16/t19 include all of
the Gauss point stresses. It is therefore suggested that whenever
possible, the t16/t19 files be used with postprocessor programs
that can read them. Strains are handled the same way as stresses.
MARCGAUS=2, MSC.Marc output stresses and strains will be at
the center and at the grid points for solid elements (the maximum
stress from any Gauss point is determined and compatible stresses
for that Gauss point are placed at the center and at each of the grid
points). Shell/plate stresses are at the center (top and bottom
surfaces). The maximum Gauss point stress at each surface is
found and a compatible set if stresses at that Gauss point are
placed in the center of the surface. Strains are handled the same
way as stresses. marcgaus=0 is the same as marcgaus=2.
MARCGAUS=3, solid stresses/and strains are the same as option
1 and plate stresses/strains are the same as option 2.
MARCGAUS=4, solid stresses/and strains are the same as option

This parameter is used only for eigenvalue analysis in the
MSC.Nastran-MSC.Marc interface where natural frequencies or
buckling modes need to be calculated using the deformed
geometry from a nonlinear analysis. The parameter is only
necessary if the last nonlinear increment created a non-positive
definite matrix. When MARCRBAL=1 is set, the system will be
rebalanced and a positive-definite matrix is assured. Do not use
this parameter unless it is known that a non-positive definite
system occurs just prior to eigenvalue analysis.

MCONTACT

The ratios of terms on the diagonal of the stiffness matrix to the
corresponding terms on the diagonal of the triangular factor are
computed. If, for any row, this ratio is greater than MAXRATIO,
the matrix will be considered to be nearly singular (having
mechanisms). If any diagonal terms of the factor are negative, the
stiffness matrix is considered implausible (nonpositive definite).
The ratios greater than MAXRATIO and less than zero and their
associated external grid identities will be printed out. The
program will then take appropriate action as directed by the
parameter BAILOUT.
By default, in the superelement solution sequences the program
will terminate processing for that superelement. A negative value
for BAILOUT directs the program to continue processing the
superelement. Although forcing the program to continue with
near-singularities is a useful modeling checkout technique, it may
lead to solutions of poor quality or fatal messages later in the run.
It is recommended that the default values be used for production
runs. A related parameter is ERROR.
The value -1 of BAILOUT causes the program to continue
processing with near singularities and a zero value will cause the
program to exit if near singularities are detected.
In SOLs 101 through 200 when PARAM,CHECKOUT,YES is
specified, PARAM,MAXRATIO sets the tolerance for detecting
multipoint constraint equations with poor linear independence.
(See “Superelement Analysis” on page 470 of the MSC.Nastran

This parameter allows the user to create a set of contact MPC’s
which remain constant throughout the analysis. A second
MSC.Marc analysis is spawned using the contact MPC’s and the
original contact definitions are removed. The value of N is used to
determine when to pick the contact MPC’s. For N=0, MPC’s are
determined during MSC.Marc’s increment 0. For N>0, MPC’s are
determined at the end of increment N. For N<0, the first set of
contact MPC’s encountered in the MSC.Marc run after increment
zero will be used and the initial MSC.Marc run will execute for
abs(N) increments.
This option is useful in certain circumstances. For example, spot
welds where the weld beads are modeled as solid elements and
placed between plate elements and the connections occur only due
to contact, or to connect two parts with mesh mismatches using
contact. Use of this parameter causes MSC.Nastran to spawn
MSC.Marc once to determine the requested contact MPC’s, and
then to either spawn MSC.Marc again with contact definitions
removed and the contact MPC’s active or to spawn another
MSC.Nastran nonlinear run using the contact MPC’s. Whether to
spawn MSC.Marc or MSC.Nastran for the second run is
determined by PARAM,RCONTACT. If PARAM,RCONTACT is
omitted but PARAM,MCONTACT is entered, MSC.Marc will be
spawned for the second run.

MINIGOA

MHOUBOLT=4, SOL 600 transient dynamics will use the fast
explicit numerical integration method.
MINIGOA

Default = No
Allows for the reduction in the amount of disk space used when
using superelements. When this parameter is set to YES, the
transformation matrix GOA will contain terms only for the
degrees-of-freedom in the U5 (USET, USET1, SEUSET, SEUSET1)
set. This can allow for a significant reduction in the amount of disk
space used by the database. The limitation of using this approach
is that data recovery will be available only for these degrees-offreedom and elements connected to them.

MINRECCC

Integer, Default = 0, for MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL
600) only

N

Minimum number of iterations per load step. This is the same as
MINREC on the NLSTRAT entry. If no other NLSTRAT values are
entered, it is easier to enter this parameter. The value can range
from 0 to 9. For certain problems, the value should be 2 or greater
or accuracy will be poor.

MMFIL

Default = 1.e-10
Filter value used to distinguish between massless mechanism
modes and rigid body modes. A smaller value may discard rigid
body modes. The default value has been effective on all problems

Name

Name of a file containing temperature dependent stress versus
plastic strain curves in MSC.Marc’s AF_flowmat format. This file
can be generated from the current MSC.Nastran run using
TABLEST and TABLES1 entries or a pre-existing file can be used
depending on the value of PARAM,MRAFFLOR. The extension
“.mat” will be added to Name. If this is a new file, it will be saved
in the directory from which the MSC.Nastran execution is
submitted. If a pre-existing file is to be used, it can either be located
in the directory where the MSC.Nastran execution is submitted or
in the MSC.Marc AF_flowmat directory.

MRALIAS,

Integer, no default, for MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600)
only This parameter is not usually used.

MALIAS02,

The purpose of the parameter is to map the MSC.Marc element
type selected by the internal MSC.Marc translator in MSC.Nastran
to a different type. For example if the element type 75 for
CQUAD4 is normally used, a mapping to MSC.Marc element type
139 could be made. ID is a 6 digit number. The left 3 digits are the
element type normally selected by the translator and the right 3
digits are the element type to be mapped. In the above example,
element type 75 is to be mapped to 139. The user would enter
ID=075139. If element type 165 is to be mapped to element type 1
(which is not a real case), ID=165001. Consult MSC.Marc Volume
B for a list of elements and their meaning. The user is responsible
for ensuring that the mapping selected is proper. There is a limit
of 18 aliases that may be entered in any model. Since
MSC.Nastran can only accept one parameter with a given name,
the second alias should be named PARAM,MALIAS02 and the
third PARAM,MALIAS03, etc. All original element types mapped
must actually exist in the model.

MALIAS03, etc.

Note:

If you use one of the MRALIAS parameters, certain “parameters”
in the MSC.Marc file may no longer be correct. For example, an
element originally capabile of using the updated Lagrange
method may be aliased to one that must use the total Lagrange
method. Such conditions are not checked by the translator when
you use alias and you will need to make modifications to the
MSC.Marc input file yourself to reflect them.

NLAYERS

NLAYERS

NLAYERS is used in material nonlinear analysis only and is the
number of layers used to integrate through the thickness of
CQUAD4 and CTRlA3 elements with isotropic material properties.
Set NLAYERS=1 for efficiency if no bending is selected (MID2=0 or
-1 on all PSHELL data entries). Do not specify NLAYERS=1 if MID2
is greater than zero. A larger value of NLAYERS will give greater
accuracy at the cost of computing time and storage requirements.

trial mm’s is reduced to NLMAX. This is a means to avoid an
expensive debug run when there may be thousands of mm’s due to
systematic modeling error, such as having CONM2 elements on
many grid points for which structural elements have been left out
through oversight. The value of this parameter may be increased on
initial debug runs where it is possible that there are many high ratio
DOFs, and you’d rather see them all at once rather than on
successive runs where you remove only a part of them at one time.

NODCMP

NODCMP

Default =
For some type of nonlinear transient problems, including heat
transfer, the decomposition of the solution matrix is not required. In

By default, if converted data already exists on the files indicated by
GEOMU, POSTU, and LOADU, then the DBC module will overwrite
the old data. If this is not desirable, then PARAM,DBCOVWRT,NO
must be entered. The parameters MODEL and SOLID may be used
to store more than one model and solution in the graphics database.
These parameters are not supported by MSC.Patran.
PARAM,DBCDlAG > 0 requests the printing of various diagnostic
messages from the DBC module (see MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP
Programmer’s Guide) during the data conversion. By default, no
messages are printed.
If PARAM,POST,<0, then the following parameters and discussion
apply:
PARAM,POST,-1 outputs the appropriate files for the MSC.Patran
NASPAT program. PARAM,POST,-2 outputs the appropriate files
for the EDS I-DEAS program. PARAM,POST,-4 outputs the files
indicated below along with OPHIG for the MSC_NF interface by
LMS International. PARAM,POST,-5 outputs the files indicated in
the table below along with LAMA and OPHG1 for the FemTools
interface by Dynamic Design Solutions. POST=-4 and -5 are
intended for SOL 103 only. PARAM,POST,-6 outputs the files
indicated below for EDS Unigraphics.
An OUTPUT2 file for FORTRAN unit 12 in binary format is
automatically created in the same directory and with the same name
as the input file and with the extension “.op2". For example, if the
input file is fender.dat then the OUTPUT2 file will be called
fender.op2.
An ASSIGN statement is required in the FMS Section only if neutral
file format is desired as follows:

PRPA,

PRPA,

Default=1.0E37

PRPJ

PRPA and PRPJ control the printout of intermediate load matrices
for diagnostic purposes during superelement assembly. If the value
of PRPA (or PRPJ) is positive, all terms larger in magnitude than the
value are printed. If the value of PRPA (or PRPJ) is negative, all
terms smaller in magnitude than the value are printed. The default
value requests no printout. PARAM,IRES,1 must be present for
these parameters to be effective. The PA matrix contains the internal
loads transmitted to the downstream superelement. The PJ matrix
contains external loads applied on the superelement; that is, it has
the same content as the data produced by the Case Control command
OLOAD. All of this data may be obtained on restart using the SELR
Case Control command option. A related parameter is IRES.

PRPHIVZ

Default=1.0E37
PRPHIVZ controls the printout of the PHlVZ matrix that contains
the component mode eigenvectors of the model. It includes all
degrees-of-freedom with motion except the m-set, eliminated for
multipoint constraints. The FAPPROX matrix contains the square
root of the diagonal terms of the generalized stiffness matrix divided
by 2π. For fixed-boundary solutions, it is a good approximation for
the natural frequencies of the component. For free- or
mixed-boundary solutions, it is of a lower value than the natural
frequencies. All terms larger than PRPHlVZ in both matrices will be

NUMOUT, in conjunction with BIGER, controls the amount of stress
output.
1. NUMOUT = +N requests that N element stresses be
printed (or punched) for each element type.
2. NUMOUT=0 outputs all elements in a group when one or
more exceeds BIGER. Some of the elements will have
stresses small than BIGER. This is conceptually the same as
describing an element set in case control, and limiting
output in this manner. Stress files obtained with element
group filtering may be used for xy plotting and other
postprocessor options with DMAP alters. By contrast, the
stress file when NUMOUT = -2 is more discontinuous, and
may not be used for xy plotting.
3. NUMOUT = 0 does not sort but filters according to BIGER
by element group. In static analysis an element group is
defined as all case control selected elements for a given load
case for SORT1 output. For SORT2 output an element
group is defined as the data for a given element type for all
load cases. In transient analysis an element group is
defined as all case control selected elements at a given time
for SORT1 output. For SORT2 output an element group is
defined as the data for a given element at all time steps. The
element group option applies only to output types
described above for PARAM,S1. This option is not
available with output types selected by PARAMs S1G and
S1M.
4. NUMOUT = -1 requests that stresses be sorted and only
those stresses with an absolute value that is greater than
BlGER will be output.
5. NUMOUT = -2 (the default) does not sort but filters
according to BIGER. Related parameters include BIGER,
NOELOF, NOELOP, and NOGPF.
BIGER controls the elements for which stresses will be printed.
Elements with stresses that are smaller in absolute value than BIGER
will not be output. The quantity tested is element type dependent.
Related parameters include CURV, NUMOUT, S1, S1G, and S1M.
SRTOPT controls the scanning option to be performed.

SRSS, NRL, or NRLO options are used, close natural frequencies will
be summed by the ABS convention, where close natural frequencies

SEMAPPRT

Default=3
The superelement map (SEMAP table) contains several lists useful
for determining how the program has partitioned superelement
models. It is printed automatically each time this table is generated.
It consists of three major parts:
GPM

ISM

SDT

The Grid Point Map contains a list of each grid point, its
interior superelement placement, and the SElD of all
grid points connected directly to it by elements. Three
tables follow that summarize the connectivity between
superelements, sorted on grid point sequence, SElD,
and the number of connections.
The Individual Superelement Map lists the interior grid
points, exterior grid and scalar points, elements, and
time and storage space estimates for each
superelement.
The Superelement Definition Table contains the SEID of
every superelement in the model, the processing order,
and a pictorial representation of the superelement tree.

SEMAP, SEMAPOPT, and SEMAPPRT are used to control the
amount of output that is printed and other special features. The
possible values for SEMAP are shown in the following table.

No output is printed. The exterior grid points of the superelement
with a SEID that is input on SEMAPOPT are placed on a CSUPER
entry image on the PUNCH file, allowing the superelement to be
used as an external superelement. If SEMAPOPT > 0, the
superelement entry is given an SSID of SEMAPOPT. If
SEMAPOPT < 0, the exterior points listed are those of the residual
structure, but the CSUPER entry is given an SSID of
|SEMAPOPT|.

Default=AUTO
By default, all restarts are considered automatic (see “Restart
Procedures” on page 398 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide). If
none of the following Case Control commands are entered, then
SEALL=ALL is the default action: SEMG, SELG, SEKR, SELR, SELA,
SEMA, SEMR, and SEALL.
These commands may be used to partition the analysis into several
runs. By default, the restart will proceed in automatic fashion for
each command, regenerating only that data that is affected by
modifications in the Bulk Data and Case Control or changes in
upstream superelements. If the user wishes to overwrite the data,
even if it is not affected by modifications to the data, then
PARAM,SERST,MANUAL must be entered.
With PARAM,SERST,AUTO or MANUAL, all superelements will be
processed through Phase 0 (see “Superelement Analysis” on
page 470 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide). This phase includes
execution of the sequencer module (SEQP), initial superelement
processing (SEP1), and initial geometry processing (GP1 and GP2)
modules, which can result in significant CPU overhead. If this
overhead is not desired, then PARAM,SERST,SEMI will limit Phase
0 and Phase 1 to only those superelements specified on the SEMG,
SELG, SEKR, SELR, SELA, SEMA, SEMR, and SEALL Case Control
commands. If none of these commands is entered, then execution
will skip Phase 0 and 1.
In the modal solution sequences (SOLs 110, 111, 112, 145, 146, and
200), the modes of the residual structure are automatically computed
in Phase 2 if any SE-type command (e.g., SEMG=n) is requested for
the residual structure. If PARAM,SERST,SEMI and no SE-type
command is specified for the residual structure, then, by default, its
modes will not be recomputed. This logic is intended for restarts
from SOL 103 into one of the modal solutions. If, however, the
modes have not already been computed or need to be recomputed,
then PARAM,SERST,RSMDS must be specified to force the
calculation of the residual structure modes.
If PARAM,SERST,SEDR is specified, then Phases 0, 1, and 2 will be
skipped. This option is intended for data recovery (Phase 3) runs
only.

SESDAMP

The options of SEMI, RSMDS, and SEDR are intended for models
that are defined on more than one database; i.e., superelements are
defined on separate databases (multiple MASTER DBsets) and
processed in separate runs. Also, with this technique, databases are
attached with the DBLOCATE File Management statement rather
than the RESTART File Management statement. In general, these
options are not recommended because they disable the automatic
restart capability, which compromises the database integrity.

SESDAMP

Modal damping is calculated for superelements if
PARAM,SESDAMP,YES is specified. An SDAMPING Case Control
command that selects a TABDMP1 Bulk Data entry must also be
specified in the desired superelement’s subcase. By default, modal
damping is added to viscous damping (B). If you insert
PARAM,KDAMP,-1 (or PARAM,KDAMPFL,-1 for fluid
superelements) then modal damping will be added to structural
damping (K4).

branched over for tip superelements. If SESEF = -1 (the default

responses are also taken into consideration for determining which
grid points are needed for data recovery.
SPARSEDM=YES is for SOL 200 and takes further advantage of
small design models/responses during the adjoint or pseudo-load

These methods take advantage of very small output requests,

in significant CPU and disk space savings.

If, however, the output requests and/or the size of the design model

percentage of degrees-of-freedom, then it is more efficient to
compute the solution at all grid points. The user PARAMeter
SPDRRAT (Default75) and SPDMRAT (Default60) specifies this
percentage.

In SOLs 109 and 112 restarts from previous SOLs 109 and 112 runs,
STIME is used to specify the proper starting time of the restart run.
If STIME exceeds the last output time of the previous run, the
starting time is assumed to be the last output time. Otherwise, the
starting time is assumed to be the output time of the previous run
(not necessarily the last output time) that is closest to STIME. In
other words, the starting time of the restart run need not be the last
output time of the previous run, but may be any time earlier than
that. The program informs the user that it is a restart run and
indicates the starting time (determined as above) that is used for the

also different TSTEP and dynamic loading entries in the Bulk Data

Parameters
VMOPT

VMOPT

1

Default=0
If VMOPT=1, then the virtual mass will be included in the mass
matrix at the same time as all other mass elements. In other words,
the component modes will reflect the virtual mass. By default,
virtual mass is included after the component modes are computed.

nastran

2

If VMOPT=2 the modes of the structure or component without the
fluid are computed first ("dry" modes). The fluid effects are added in
the modal basis during the residual flexibility computation to
produce the "wet" modes for the component. Both eigenvalue tables
are printed, allowing comparison of the dry and wet modes. The wet
modes are used in modal dynamic analysis. The cost savings result
from the dense Virtual Mass matrix being kept out when computing
dry modes in the physical basis. Its presence can increase memory
and computation times by an order of magnitude. The VM is added
only in the smaller generalized basis used in Residual Flexibility
Computations. The approximations introduced by this approach are
generally small due to the homogeneous nature of the fluid. This
approach was provided in earlier versions with the vma.v* series of
SSSALTERS. It is the preferred method when the number of wetted
elements exceeds several hundred, for reasons of efficiency.

VUGJUMP

Default=1000
Specifies the separation in identification numbers for display
elements and grid points generated in p-version analysis. The
defaults are sufficient for a 9 9 9 display element mesh.
Identification numbers for display elements and grid points start
with 10001001 and 201001001, respectively. For example, by default
the identification numbers for the display elements of the first
p-element will be numbered 100001001 through 100002000 and the
second p-element 100002001 through 100003000, etc.

These parameters are used in p-version analysis to specify the names
of the display elements in the data recovery output tables; such as
those created by the VUGRID Case Control command and
PARAM,POST. They should be used if your postprocessor does not
recognize display elements. For example,
PARAM,VUHEXA,CHEXA renames the display element VUHEXA
to “CHEXA” in the output files.

WRBEAMB

Integer, Default = 0
0 Write equivalent radius for all beams (see PARAM,
BEAMBEA) whether beam-beam contact is anticipated or not.
The equivalent radius is the 7th field of Marc’s GEOMETRY
values for beam type elements.
-1 Do not write equivalent radius (7th field is blank) This might
be necessary for versions of MSC.Marc earlier than 2003.

WTMASS

Default=1.0
The terms of the structural mass matrix are multiplied by the value
of WTMASS when they are generated. In coupled fluid-structure
analysis WTMASS is applied to the structural portion of the model
only. WTMASS applies to MFLUID entries but it is not
recommended for use in hydroelastic problems.

In SOLs 129 and 159, W4 may vary between subcases. However, the
linear portion of the model uses only the W4 value from the first
subcase and the values in the subsequent subcases are applied to the
nonlinear portion of the model.

Default is 0.0, no rotor damping or circulation terms.
Specifies “average” excitation frequency for calculation of rotor

on page 192 of the MSC.Nastran 2004 Release Guide for equations.

Parameters

751

XFLAG

XFLAG

Default=0
By default (XFLAG = 0), when temperature loads and element
deformations are present, the element strain energy for the linear
elements is calculated using the following equation:
T
1 T
E = --- u K e u – u P et
2

where u is the deformation, K e is the element stiffness and P et is the
element load vector for temperature differences and element
deformations. If XFLAG is set to 2, the element strain energy for
linear elements is calculated using the following equation:

1
nastran

FMS

3
EXEC

1 T
1 T
E = --- u K e u – --- u P et
2
2
The latter formula is the same strain energy calculation used for
nonlinear elements.
ZROCMAS

Default = NO
When performing component modal synthesis with free or mixed
boundary conditions, the c-set mass is normally included during the
calculation of the component modes. If the component has large
masses on the c-set degrees-of-freedom, or if the user requests too
many modes for the component, the c-set residual flexibility will
become singular. This causes a failure of the component reduction.
The singularity may be avoided by setting ZROCMAS to YES, which
will exclude the c-set mass when calculating the component modes.

Item Codes

Item codes are integer numbers assigned to specific output quantities; such as, the
third translational component of displacement, the major principal stress at Z1 in a
CQUAD4 element, or the torque in a CBAR element. Item codes are specified on the
following input statements:

• DRESP1 entry for Design Sensitivity and Optimization (SOL 200).

2
FMS

• X-Y Plotting commands. See “Plotting” on page 527 of the MSC.Nastran
Reference Guide.

• DSCONS entry for Original Design Sensitivity (DSA).
• DTI,INDTA entry for stress sorting.

3
EXEC

The following tables provide item codes for:

• Table 6-1. Element Stress or Strain.
• Table 6-2. Element Force.

• Table 6-3. Fluid Virtual Mass Pressure.
• Table 6-4. Heat Transfer Flux.
• Table 6-5. Slideline Contact Output.
• Table 6-6. Element Strain Energy Item Codes.
The following superscripts appear in the tables and indicate:
1. Data for components marked with the symbol (1) are included in the data
block MES output from module DRMS1. (See MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP
Programmer’s Guide.)
2. Composite Element Stresses and Failure Indices.

Element Stress (or Strain) Item Codes

1

All item codes refer to stresses (or strains) unless otherwise denoted.
If output is magnitude/phase, the magnitude replaces the real part, and the phase
replaces the imaginary part. Strain item codes are equivalent to stress item codes.
However, strain is computed for only some elements. See Table 3-1 in the
MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.

*Strictly speaking, sb and sg are not exclusive with respect to one another. Degreesof-freedom may exist in both sets simultaneously. Since these sets are not used
explicitly in the solution sequences, this need not concern the user. However, those
who use these sets in their own DMAPs should avoid redundant specifications

Degree-of-Freedom Sets

when using these sets for partitioning or merging operations. That is, a degree-offreedom should not be specified on both a PS field of a GRID entry (sg set) and on a
selected SPC entry (sb set). Redundant specifications will cause UFM 2120 in the
VEC module and behavior listed in MSC.Nastran 2005 DMAP Programmer’s Guide
for the UPARTN module. These sets are exclusive, however, from the other
mutually exclusive sets.

The a-set and o-set are created in the following ways:
1. If only OMITi entries are present, then the o-set consists of degrees-offreedom listed explicitly on OMITi entries. The remaining f-set degrees-offreedom are placed in the b-set, which is a subset of the a-set.
2. If ASETi or QSETi entries are present, then the a-set consists of all degreesof-freedom listed on ASETi entries and any entries listing its subsets, such as
QSETi, SUPORTi, CSETi, and BSETi entries. Any OMITi entries are
redundant. The remaining f-set degrees-of-freedom are placed in the o-set.
3. If there are no ASETi, QSETi, or OMITi entries present but there are
SUPORTi, BSETi, or CSETi entries present, then the entire f-set is placed in
the a-set and the o-set is not created.
4. There must be at least one explicity ASETi, QSETi, or OMITi entry for the
o-set to exist, even if the ASETi, QSETi, or OMITi entry is redundant.
In dynamic analysis, additional vector sets are obtained by a modal transformation
derived from real eigenvalue analysis of the a-set. These sets are as follows:
ξ o = rigid body (zero frequency) modal degrees-of-freedom
ξ f = finite frequency modal degrees-of-freedom

The Bulk Data Section
The Bulk Data Section contains entries that specify model geometry, element
connectivity, element and material properties, constraints (boundary conditions), and
loads. Some entries, such as loads and constraints, are selected by an appropriate Case
Control command.
Entries are prepared in either fixed or free field format. The descriptions in this section
show only the fixed format. Entries that are used by the MSGMESH program are not
included in this guide. For a description of the various format options and the
MSGMESH entries, see the “Use of Parameters” on page 35 of the MSC.Nastran

Format of Bulk Data Entries
Real, Integer, and Character Input Data
MSC.Nastran is quite particular about the input requirements for data entry. The three
possible types of data entries are Integer, Real, and Character (sometimes called
literal, or BCD-binary coded decimal). The three types of data are described as follows:
Integer

Cannot contain a decimal point.

Real

Must contain a decimal point.

Character

Can be alphanumeric, but must always start with an alpha character
and be 8 characters or less in length.

1
nastran

2
FMS

3
EXEC

Real numbers may be entered in a variety of ways. For example, the following are all
acceptable versions of the real number seven:
7.0

.7E1

0.7+1

.70+1

7.E+0

70.-1

Free, Small, and Large Field Formats
MSC.Nastran has three different field formats for input data:
Free Field Format

Input data fields are separated by commas.

Small Field Format

Ten fields of eight characters each.

Large Field Format

Ten fields-fields containing actual data are sixteen
characters each. Large fields are used when greater
numerical accuracy is required.

The NASTRAN statement, File Management Section, Executive Control Section, and
Case Control Section use free field format. The Bulk Data Section allows the use of any
of the three formats.
MSC.Nastran Bulk Data contains ten fields per input data entry. The first field
contains the character name of the Bulk Data item (e.g., GRID, CBAR, MAT1, etc.).
Fields two through nine contain data input information for the Bulk Data entry. The
tenth field never contains data-it is reserved for entry continuation information, if
applicable.
Consider the format of a typical MSC.Nastran Bulk Data entry, the GRID entry, which
is used in MSC.Nastran to describe the geometry of the structural model.

We will now represent this example in free field, small field, and large field formats.
Free Field Format
In free field format, data fields are separated by commas or blanks (commas are
strongly recommended). The following shows the GRID Bulk Data entry example in
free field format:
GRID,2,,1.0,-2.0,3.0,,136

These two commas
indicate an empty field
The rules for free field format are as follows:

• Free field data entries must start in column 1.
• To skip one field, use two commas in succession. To skip two fields, use three

7
SETS

8
BULK

commas in succession (and so on).

• Integer or character fields with more than eight characters cause a fatal error.
• Real numbers with more than eight characters are rounded off and lose some
precision. For example, an entry of 1.2345678+2 becomes 123.4568. If more
significant digits are needed, use the large field format.

• Free field data cannot contain embedded blanks. An example of a free field
embedded blank is shown below:

• A dollar sign terminates the entry and comments may follow.
The free field data entry capability in MSC.Nastran have been enhanced to support
easy to use data input formats. The following examples illustrate the possible forms of
the free field data input and the resulting translation to the fixed-field format.

If more than 80 characters of data are required, the free field may be continued in the
next line provided that the next entry starts with a comma in the first column. The next

BULK

A high degree of numerical accuracy is required in some MSC.Nastran applications.
Large field format is used when small field format does not provide enough
significant digits (recall that a minus sign, decimal point, and the “E” in scientific
notation count as characters).
Large field format requires (at least) two lines for each entry: the first and last field of
each line contains eight columns, and the fields in between contain 16 columns. Short
field becomes two lines. Large field entries are denoted by an asterisk (*) immediately
following the character string in field 1A of the first line and immediately preceding
the character string in field 1B of the second line.

Continuations

Some Bulk Data entries require more than eight fields (72 columns) of data.
Continuations are required in such cases. To do this, a parent entry (the first line) is
followed by one or more continuation entries on subsequent lines. For example,
consider the following PBAR simple beam property entry (do not worry about what
each field represents-this will be explained later):

+PB1 in field 10 of the parent entry is an arbitrary (and unique) user-defined pointer
to field 1 of the second line. +PB2 in the second line points the third line, and so on.
Continuation fields can also be generated automatically by MSC.Nastran (this
approach is the recommended practice). To automatically generate a continuation, the
continuation line (or lines) must immediately follow the parent Bulk Data entry. In
addition, fields 1 and 10 of the continuation line (or lines) must be left blank. In the
case of double-width generated continuations are not blank in field 1, but have an “*”
in column 1. MSC.Nastran will then generate unique continuations for you. This
process is illustrated in the following example:

Continuation fields (fields one and ten) are replicated using the following
conventions:
1. Only letters of the alphabet and integers may be used. They are coded into a
base 36 number. That is, the sequence of numbers is 0,1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, ...

1
nastran

2. The first character in field one or ten is not incremented.
3. The continuation fields are incremented by +1 regardless of the value
specified by the user.
4. The number of characters in an incremented field will not be increased. For
example, if the first field is “0", the thirty-seventh field will also be “0",
resulting in an illegal entry. A method to solve this problem would be to start
with a first field of “00". This will provide thirty-six squared unique fields.

Remarks:
1. Only one ACMODL entry is allowed. In general, for large irregular models,
it is recommended that, initially, this entry not be used, so the defaults will
be applied.
2. For METHOD=”BW” and INTER = “DIFF” (default), FSET and SSET refer to
either grids or elements as selected below. For INTER = “IDENT”, FSET and
SSET refer to grids.
a. For INTER = “DIFF”, INFOR = “ELEMENTS”, for FSET, the search
algorithm is restricted to elements referenced by FSET. For SSET, the
search algorithm is restricted to elements referenced by SSET. This allows
the user to de-select specific structural faces of a solid structural element.
Both these sets are optional and the user can have one without the other.
b. For INTER = “DIFF”, INFOR = “GRIDS”, for FSET, the search algorithm
is restricted to grids referenced by FSET. This allows the user to deselect
fluid grids. Fluid grid selection is the only way to deselect specific fluid
faces. For SSET, the search algorithm is restricted to grids referenced by
SSET. This allows the user to de-select structural grids. Both these sets are
optional and the user can have one without the other.

c. For INTER = “IDENT”, INFOR = “ALL”, the points referenced by FSET
and SSET must lie exactly on the fluid-structure interface. These sets are
optional, but if used, both must be present or no fluid interface is
calculated.
3. For INTER = “DIFF”, a .PCH file is created with a SET1 representing the
fluid “skin” and a SET1 representing the structure interface. This file is
useful for graphic post-processing for viewing the interface. It also produces
the sets that can be used as FSET and SSET.
4. For ALLSSET = ‘NO’ (default) the elements and grids determined by the
couplings algorithm are written to the .PCH file. The user can then deselect
elements or grids as defined by the .PCH file by editing them out of the SET1
entries defined in the file and referencing the edited SET1 with the SSET. To
add structural elements that the coupling algorithm did not include in the
.PCH file, it is not sufficient to just include them on the SET1 entry referenced
by SSET. In addition, ALLSSET = ‘YES’ must be specified.
5. NORMAL determines the height of the fluid box in the outward normal
direction to the fluid surface. The fluid box is used to locate the structural
elements used in defining the fluid-structure coupling matrix. If L is the
smallest edge of the fluid element surface, then the height of the box is L x
NORMAL.
For INTER = “IDENT”, NORMAL = .001 is the default and represents a
tolerance, in units of length, used in determining the fluid-structure
interface.
6. SKNEPS represents the enlargement of the plane of the fluid surface used to
define the search box. The diagonal distance from the center of the fluid
surface to each surface grid is pushed out (diagonal x (1. + SKNEPS)).

8. INTOL represents a normal direction into the fluid for the case when the
fluid protrudes past the structural interface. It is defined as L x INTOL where

side of the rigid surface. A deformable surface which contacts a rigid surface
must be on the exterior side of the rigid surface (i.e., in the direction opposite
to the right hand rule). If a rigid surface is described backwards, contact will

Data entry. This is the master line. For symmetrical penetration, the width
of each master segment must also be defined. See the Bulk Data entry,
“BWIDTH” on page 1008 for the details of specifying widths.
4. SFAC may be used to scale the penalty values automatically calculated by
the program. The program calculates the penalty value as a function of the
diagonal stiffness matrix coefficients that are in the contact region. In
addition to SFAC, penalty values calculated by the program may be further
scaled by the ADPCON parameter (see description of ADPCON parameter
for more details). The penalty value is then equal to k*SFAC*|ADPCON|,
where k is a function of the local stiffness. It should be noted that the value
in SFAC applies to only one contact region, whereas the ADPCON
parameter applies to all the contact regions in the model.
5. The referenced FRICID is the identification number of the BFRIC Bulk Data
entry. The BFRLC defines the frictional properties for the contact region.
6. In an unsymmetrical contact algorithm only slave nodes are checked for
penetration into master segments. This may result in master nodes
penetrating the slave line. However, the error depends only on the mesh
discretization. In symmetric penetration both slave and master nodes are
checked for penetration. Thus, no distinction is made between slave and
master. Symmetric penetration may be up to thirty percent more expensive
than the unsymmetric penetration.
7. In Figure 8-1, the unit vector in the Z-axis of the coordinate system defines
the slideline plane vector. The slideline plane vector is normal to the
slideline plane. Relative motions outside the slideline plane are ignored, and
therefore must be small compared to a typical master segment. For a master
segment the direction from master node 1 to master node 2 gives the
tangential direction (t). The normal direction for a master segment is
obtained by the cross product of the slideline plane vector with the unit
tangent vector (i.e., n=z x t). The definition of the coordinate system should
be such that the normal direction must point toward the slave region. For
symmetric, penetration, the normals of master segments and slave segments
must face each other. This is generally accomplished by traversing from
master line to slave line in a counterclockwise or clockwise fashion
depending on whether the slideline plane vector forms a right-hand or
left-hand coordinate system with the slideline plane.

OUTPUT

Remarks:
1. This identification number must be unique with respect to all other friction
identification numbers. This is used in the FRICID field of BCONP Bulk
Data entry.
2. The value of frictional stiffness requires care. A method of choosing its value
is to divide the expected frictional strength (MU1*expected normal force) by
a reasonable value of the relative displacement that may be allowed before
slip occurs. The relative value of displacement before slip occurs must be
small compared to expected relative displacements during slip. A large
stiffness value may cause poor convergence, while too small a value may
cause poor accuracy.
Frictional stiffness specified by the user is selected as the initial value. If
convergence difficulties are encountered during the analysis, the frictional
stiffness may be reduced automatically to improve convergence.
3. The stiffness matrix for frictional slip is unsymmetric. However, the
program does not use the true unsymmetric matrix. Instead the program
uses only the symmetric terms. This is to avoid using the unsymmetric
solver to reduce CPU time.

991

Boundary Line Segments

Remarks:
1. A line segment is defined between every two consecutive grid points. Thus,
the number of line segments defined is equal to the number of grid points
specified minus 1. A corresponding BWlDTH Bulk Data entry may be
required to define the width/thickness of each line segment. If the
corresponding BWlDTH is not present, the width/thickness for each line
segment is assumed to be unity.
2. ID must be unique with respect to all other BLSEG entries. Each line segment
has a width in 3-D sideline and a thickness in a 2-D slideline contact to
calculate contact stresses. The width/thickness of each line segment is
defined via BWIDTH Bulk Data entry. The ID in BLSEG must be same as the
ID specified in the BWlDTH. That is, there must be a one to one
correspondence between BLSEG and BWlDTH. BWlDTH Bulk Data entry
may be omitted only if the width/thickness of each segment is unity.
3. For automatic generation of grid numbers, the default increment value is 1 if
grid numbers are increasing or -1 if grid numbers are decreasing (i.e., the
user need not specify BY and the increment value).
4. The normal to the segment is determined by the cross product of the slideline
plane vector (i.e., the Z direction of the coordinate system defined in the
‘ClD’ field of BCONP Bulk Data entry) and the tangential direction of the
segment. The tangential direction is the direction from node 1 to node 2 of
the line segment.
5. A curve may be closed or open. A closed curve is specified by having the last
grid point identification number the same as the first grid number.

1. Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other
element identification numbers.
2. If only G1 is specified then a point impedance is assumed. If G1 and G2 are
specified then a line impedance is assumed. If G1, G2, and G3 are specified,
then an impedance is associated with the area of the triangular face. If G1
through G4 are specified, then an impedance is associated with the
quadrilateral face. See Figure 8-2.
3. The CAABSF element must connect entirely to fluid points on the
fluid-structure boundary.

Remarks:
1. The boxes and corner point nodes are numbered sequentially, beginning
with EID. The user should be careful to ensure that all box and corner point
node numbers are unique. There can be overlapping ID’s between the
structural and aerodynamic model, but MSC.Patran will not then be able to
display any results. Also, non-unique corner ID’s are allowed, but results
cannot be visualized in MSC.Patran.
2. The number of division points is one greater than the number of boxes.
Thus, if NSPAN=3, the division points are 0.0, 0.333, 0.667, 1.000. If the user
supplies division points, the first and last points need not be 0. and 1. (In
which case the corners of the panel would not be at the reference points.)
3. A triangular element is formed if X12 or X43=0.0
4. The element coordinate system is right-handed as shown in Figure 8-3.
5. The continuation is required.
6. It is recommended that NCHORD or LCHORD be chosen so that the typical
box chord length ∆x satisfies the condition ∆x < 0.08 V ⁄ f (recent studies
indicate that .02 V ⁄ f is needed to get converged stability derivatives) where
V is the minimum velocity and f, in hertz, is the maximum frequency to be
analyzed (see the MSC.Nastran Aeroelastic Analysis User’s Guide).

6. See “Grid Point and Coordinate System Definition” on page 41 of the
MSC.Nastran Reference Guide for a definition of coordinate system
terminology.
7. Offset vectors are treated like rigid elements and are therefore subject to the
same limitations.

• Offset vectors are not affected by thermal loads.
• The specification of offset vectors is not recommended in solution
sequences that compute differential stiffness because the offset vector
remains parallel to its original orientation. (Differential stiffness is
computed in buckling analysis provided in SOLs 103 and 107 through
112 with the STATSUB command; and also in nonlinear analysis
provided in SOLs 106, 129, 153, and 159 with PARAM,LGDISP,1.)

• BAR elements with offsets will give wrong buckling results.
• Masses are not offset for shells.
• The nonlinear solution in SOL 106 uses differential stiffness due for
the iterations to reduce equilibrium errors. An error in the differential
stiffness due to offsets may cause the iterations to converge slowly or
to diverge. If the solution converges the answer is correct, even
though there may be an error in the differential stiffness. However,
the special capabilities in SOL 106 to get vibration and buckling
modes will produce wrong answers if the differential stiffness is bad.

• The internal “rigid elements” for offset BAR/BEAM elements are
rotated in the nonlinear force calculations. Thus, if convergence is
achieved, BAR/BEAM elements may be used in SOL 106 with
LGDISP,1.
8. OFFT is a character string code that describes how the offset and orientation
vector components are to be interpreted. By default (string input is GGG or
blank), the offset vectors are measured in the displacement coordinate
systems at grid points A and B and the orientation vector is measured in the
displacement coordinate system of grid point A. At user option, the offset
vectors can be measured in an offset coordinate system relative to grid points
A and B, and the orientation vector can be measured in the basic system as
indicated in the following table:

Any attempt to specify invalid combinations results in a bulk data entry

The offset system x-axis is defined from GA to GB. The orientation vector v
and the offset system x-axis are then used to define the z and y axes of the
offset system.

1. This entry defines intermediate locations on the axis of selected CBAR
elements for additional data recovery. The values of Xi are actual distances
along the length if SCALE = “LE”. If SCALE = “FR”, the values of Xi are
ratios of actual distances to the bar length. A PLOAD1 Bulk Data entry for
the CBAR element in question must be present to obtain intermediate data
recovery.
2. When the alternate format is used, a series of locations Xi = X[i-1]+DELTAX,

3. If a CBARAO or PLOAD1 entry is specified and stress and/or force output
is requested, then the stresses and/or forces will be calculated at each
location Xi and output as a separate line. The force and stress values at the
end points of the beam will always be output. This output format will be
used for all beam and bar elements.
4. Intermediate loads on the element defined by the PLOAD1 entry will be
accounted for in the calculation of element stresses and forces. If no
PLOAD1 entry is defined for the element, the shear forces are constant, the
moments are linear, and it is not necessary that the user define additional
points.
5. For each bar element, either the basic format or the alternate format, but not
both, may be used. A maximum of six internal points can be specified with
the basic form. The end points must not be listed because data will be
generated for them, as explained in Remark 3. If more than six unequally
spaced internal points are desired, it is advisable to subdivide the bar into
two or more elements.

Coordinate system identification of spring-damper offset. See
Remark 9. (Integer > -1; Default = -1, which means the offset point lies
on the line between GA and GB according to Figure 8-17)

S1, S2, S3

Components of spring-damper offset in the OCID coordinate system if
OCID > 0. See Figure 8-18 and Remark 9. (Real)

Remarks:
1. Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other
element identification numbers.
2. Figure 8-17 shows the bush element geometry.
3. CID > 0 overrides GO and Xi. Then the element x-axis is along T1, the
element y-axis is along T2, and the element z-axis is along T3 of the CID
coordinate system. If the CID refers to a cylindrical coordinate system or a
spherical coordinate system, then grid GA is used to locate the system. If for
cylindrical or spherical coordinate, GA falls on the z-axis used to define
them, it is recommended that another CID be selected to define the element
x-axis.
4. For noncoincident grids ( GA ≠ GB ), when GO or (X1, X2, X3) is given and
no CID is specified, the line AB is the element x-axis and the orientation
vector v lies in the x-y plane (similar to the CBEAM element).
5. For noncoincident grids ( GA ≠ GB ), if neither GO or (X1, X2, X3) is specified
and no CID is specified, then the line AB is the element x-axis. This option is
valid only when K1 (or B1) or K4 (or B4) or both on the PBUSH entry are
specified (but K2, K3, K5, K6 or B2, B3, B5, B6 are not specified). If K2, K3,
K5, or K6 (or B2, B3, B5, or B6) are specified, a fatal message will be issued.

10. When CID > 0, the element x-axis is set as in Remark 3. This means that the
element force is always computed as Ke ⋅ ( UB – UA ) ; if UA > UB , a
compressive force will result. This is unlike the GO or Xi options, where
relative positive elongation in tension and relative negative elongation is
compression.

CBUSH

1045

Generalized Spring-and-Damper Connection

11. The CBUSH element is designed to satisfy rigid body equilibrium
requirements. For noncoincident grids, internal rigid links connect the bush
location to the grid locations. This results in coupling between translational
and rotational degrees-of-freedom at the grids even when no rotational
springs or dampers are specified on the PBUSH.

Remarks:
1. The CGAP element is intended for the nonlinear solution sequences 106, 129,
153, and 159. However, it will produce a linear stiffness matrix for the other
solutions, but remains linear with the initial stiffness. The stiffness used
depends on the value for the initial gap opening (U0 field in the PGAP entry).

CGAP

1081

Gap Element Connection

2. The gap element coordinate system is defined by one of two following
methods:

• If the coordinate system (CID field) is specified, the element
coordinate system is established using that coordinate system, in
which the element x-axis is in the T1 direction and the y-axis in the T2
direction. The orientation vector v will be ignored in this case.

• If the CID field is blank and the grid points GA and GB are not

coincident (distance from A to B ≥ 10 –4 ), then the line AB is the
element x-axis and the orientation vector v lies in the x-y plane (like
the CBEAM element).

3. The element coordinate system does not rotate as a result of deflections.
4. Initial gap openings are specified on the PGAP entry and not derived from
the separation distance between GA and GB.
5. Forces, which are requested with the STRESS Case Control command, are
output in the element coordinate system. F x is positive for compression.
6. If CID is being used to define the element coordinate system and the CID
refers to either a cylindrical or spherical coordinate system then grid GA will
be used to locate the system. If grid GA lies on the z-axis of the cylindrical
or spherical coordinate system it is recommended that a different coordinate
system be used for this element.

The TUBE-type element has two linear sides of type TUBE. The first side
represents the outside with diameters equal to that of the outside of the tube.
The second side represents the inside with diameters equal to that of the
inside of the tube.
Point Sides -- Point sides may be used with any linear element. The direction
of the outward normals of these points is in line with the element axis, but
pointing away from the element. The area assigned to these POINT-type
sides is consistent with the element geometry.

1. Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other
element identification numbers.

quadrilateral face. G5 through G8 must be on the opposite face with G5
opposite G1, G6 opposite G2, etc.
3. The edge points, G9 to G20, are optional. Any or all of them may be deleted.
If the ID of any edge connection point is left blank or set to zero (as for G9
and G10 in the input example), the equations of the element are adjusted to
give correct results for the reduced number of connections. Corner grid
points cannot be deleted. The element is an isoparametric element (with
shear correction) in all cases.
4. Components of stress are output in the material coordinate system except for
hyperelastic elements, which are output in the basic coordinate system. The
material coordinate system is defined on the PSOLID entry.
5. The second continuation is optional.
6. For nonhyperelastic elements, the element coordinate system for the CHEXA
element is defined in terms of the three vectors R, S, and T, which join the
centroids of opposite faces.
R vector joins the centroids of faces G4-G1-G5-G8 and G3-G2-G6-G7.
S vector joins the centroids of faces G1-G2-G6-G5 and G4-G3-G7-G8.

T vector joins the centroids of faces G1-G2-G3-G4 and G5-G6-G7-G8.
The origin of the coordinate system is located at the intersection of these
vectors. The X, Y, and Z axes of the element coordinate system are chosen as
close as possible to the R, S, and T vectors and point in the same general
direction. (Mathematically speaking, the coordinate system is computed in
such a way that if the R, S, and T vectors are described in the element
coordinate system a 3 x 3 positive-definite symmetric matrix would be
produced.)

7. Scalar elements input coupled mass matrices when the second pair of fields
is entered. When uncoupled point masses are desired input only the first pair
of fields. When a coupled mass matrix is requested the submatrix added has
M on the diagonal, and -M on the off-diagonal. The element is not checked
for internal constraints, which is the user’s responsibility if desired. There are
instances where elements with internal constraints are desired, although not
frequently. To identify the presence of internal constraints caused by
coupled mass, inspect GPWG output, OLOAD output due to GRAV loads,
and rigid body modes of free structures. Some forms of coupled mass will
cause coupling of rigid body translational mass terms in GPWG output, and
poor rigid body modes in modal analysis.

if CID references a spherical or cylindrical coordinate system. This is similar
to the manner in which displacement coordinate systems are defined.

2. The temperature of the fluid film point may be specified to determine the
material properties for the fluid. If FLMND=0, the reference temperature
has several options. It can be the average of surface and ambient

defined in the FORM field of the PCONVM Bulk Data entry.
3. CNTMDOT must be set to the desired mass flow rate (mdot) to effect the
advection of energy downstream at an mdot ⋅ C p ⋅ T rate. In addition to the
effect that mdot has on the transfer of thermal energy in the streamwise
direction, this control point value is also used in computing the tube
Reynolds number and subsequently the forced convection heat transfer
coefficient if requested. This enables the fluid stream to exchange heat with
its surroundings.

Remarks:
1. Coordinate system identification numbers on all CORD1R, CORD1C,
CORD1S, CORD2R, CORD2C, CORD2S, and CORD3G entries must all be
unique.
2. The three points [(A1, A2, A3), (B1, B2, B3), (C1, C2, C3)] must be unique and
noncolinear. Noncolinearity is checked by the geometry processor. The first
point defines the origin. The second point defines the direction of the z-axis.
The third lies in the plane of the azimuthal origin. The reference coordinate
system must be independently defined.
3. The continuation entry is required.
4. If RID is zero or blank, the basic coordinate system is used.
5. The location of a grid point (P in Figure 8-40) in this coordinate system is
given by (R, θ, φ), where θ and φ are measured in degrees.
6. The displacement coordinate directions at P are shown above by
( u r, u θ, u φ ) .
7. It is recommended that points on the z-axis not have their displacement
directions defined in this coordinate system. See the discussion of spherical
coordinate systems in “Grid Point and Coordinate System Definition” on
page 41 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.
8. If any CORD2C, CORD2R, or CORD2S entry is changed or added on restart,
then a complete re-analysis is performed. Therefore, CORD2C, CORD2R, or

with respect to the local Cartesian coordinate axes (XYZ) in CIDREF as
follows: first rotate about Z-axis by θ 1 , next rotate about rotated x-axis by θ 2 ,
and then rotate about rotated z-axis by θ 3 . On the other hand, the
space-fixed rotations in 321 sequence specify all the rotations about the fixed
coordinate axes: first rotate about Z by θ 1 , next about Y by θ 2 , then about X
by θ 3 .
3. The three rotations define a coordinate transformation which transforms
position vectors in the reference coordinate system into the general

Remarks:
1. Element ID numbers must be unique with respect to all other element ID
numbers.
2. The topology of the diagram must be preserved; i.e., G1, G2, and G3 define
a triangular face, G1, G10, and G4 are on the same edge, etc.
3. The edge grid points, G7 to G15, are optional. Any or all of them may be
deleted. In the example shown, G10, G11, and G12 have been deleted. The
continuations are not required if all edge grid points are deleted.
4. Components of stress are output in the material coordinate system except for
hyperelastic elements, which are output in the basic coordinate system.
5. For nonhyperelastic elements the element coordinate system for the
CPENTA element is derived accordingly. The origin of the coordinate
system is located at the midpoint of the straight line connecting the points G1
and G4. The Z axis points toward the triangle G4-G5-G6 and is oriented
somewhere between the line joining the centroids of the triangular faces and
a line perpendicular to the midplane. The midplane contains the midpoints
of the straight lines between the triangular faces. The X and Y axes are
perpendicular to the Z axis and point in a direction toward, but not
necessarily intersecting, the edges G2 through G5 and G3 through G6,
respectively.

stresses, strains and element forces are output in the local tangent
plane of the element. The local tangents are oriented in a user defined
direction which is uniform across a set of elements. By default, the

6. Elements may be offset from the connection points by means of ZOFFS.
Other data, such as material matrices and stress fiber locations, are given
relative to the reference plane. A positive value of ZOFFS implies that the
element reference plane is offset a distance of ZOFFS along the positive
Z-axis of the element coordinate system. If the ZOFFS field is used, then the

3. The orientation of the material property coordinate system is defined locally
at each interior integration point by THETA, which is the angle between
xmaterial and the line of constant η.
The definition of the material coordinate system by projection is used to
calculate an angle THETA. Please note that since xi changes directions
throughout the element based on element shape, the material coordinate
system varies similarly. Because of this an orthotropic or anisotropic material
will cause the CQUAD8’s stiffness to be biased by both it’s shape and grid
ordering. Use the QUAD4 element if a constant material coordinate system
direction is desired with orthotropic and anisotropic materials.
4. T1, T2, T3 and T4 are optional. If they are not supplied and no TFLAG, then
T1 through T4 will be set to the value of T on the PSHELL entry.
5. It is recommended that the midside grid points be located within the middle

program may fail with a divide-by-zero error or the calculated stresses will
be meaningless.

6. Elements may be offset from the connection points by means of the ZOFFS
field. Other data, such as material matrices and stress fiber locations, are

the element reference plane is offset a distance of ZOFFS along the positive

the MID1 and MID2 fields must be specified on the PSHELL entry referenced
by PID.
The specification of offset vectors gives wrong results in solution sequences
that compute differential stiffness: linear buckling analysis provided in
SOLs 105 and 200; SOLs 103 and 107 through 112 with the STATSUB
command; and geometric nonlinear analysis provided in SOLs 106, 129, 153,
and 159 with PARAM,LGDISP,1.
7. If all midside grid points are deleted, then the element will be excessively
stiff and the transverse shear forces incorrect. A User Warning Message is
printed, and a CQUAD4 element is recommended instead. If the element is
hyperelastic, then it is processed identically to the hyperelastic CQUAD4
element.
8. For a description of the element coordinate system, see “Shell Elements

However, for hyperelastic elements the stress and strain are output in the

8. Elements may be offset from the connection points by means of ZOFFS.
Other data, such as material matrices and stress fiber locations, are given
relative to the reference plane. A positive value of ZOFFS implies that the
element reference plane is offset a distance of ZOFFS along the positive Zaxis of the element coordinate system. If the ZOFFS field is used, then the
MID1 and MID2 fields must be specified on the PSHELL entry referenced
both by PID.
The specification of offset vectors gives wrong results in solution sequences
that compute differential stiffness: linear buckling analysis provided in SOLs
105 and 200; SOLs 103 and 107 through 112 with the STATSUB command;
and geometric nonlinear analysis provided in SOLs 106, 129, 153 and 159

2. Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other
element identification numbers.
3. This element, including grid point numbering conventions, is shown in
Figure 8-51 and Figure 8-52. Grid points G1 through G10, and G19 through
G28 are required; midside and surface grid points G11 through G18, G29
through G36, and G37 through G64 are optional. Either all or none of grid
points G37 through G46 should be present. A fatal error message will be
issued for partial connectivity.
4. For the symmetric half-crack option Grid Points G1 through G7, and G19
through G25 are required, whereas grid points G11 through G14, G29
through G32, and G37 through G42 are optional. Grid points G8 through
G10, G15 through G18, G26 through G28, G33 through G36, G43 through
G46, G51 through G55, and G60 through G64 should not be specified to
invoke this option.
5. It is recommended that both the faces (formed by grid points G2 through G18
and grid points G20 through G36) and the midplane (formed by grid points
G37 through G46 and grid points G37 through G46) be planar. It is also
recommended that midside grid points G37 through G46 be located within
the middle third of the edges.
6. The midside nodes on both the faces should be defined in pairs. For
example, if grid point G11 is not defined, then grid point G29 should not be
defined and vice versa.
7. The stresses and stress intensity factors are calculated with the assumptions
that grid points G2 and G10, G20 and G28, and G38 and G46 are coincident.
Deviation from this condition will produce erroneous results.
8. The stress output is interpreted as shown in “Crack Tip Elements

CREEP

Defines creep characteristics based on experimental data or known empirical creep
law. This entry will be activated if a MAT1, MAT2, or MAT9 entry with the same MID
is used and the NLPARM entry is prepared for creep analysis. The creep formulation
is principally suited for isotropic materials and, in general, when used with
anisotropic materials may produce incorrect results. However, slightly anisotropic
materials may produce acceptable results.

Remarks:

EXEC

1. No property entry is needed for the CSPOT entry.
2. Spotweld failure due to plastic straining occurs when the effective nodal
plastic strain exceeds the input value, ε pfail . This option can model the tearing
out of a spotweld from the sheet metal since the plasticity is in the material
that surrounds the spotweld, not the spotweld itself. A least squares
algorithm is used to generate the nodal values of plastic strains at the nodes
from the element integration point values. The plastic strain is integrated
through the element and the average value is projected to the nodes via a
least square fit. This option should only be used for the material models
related to metallic plasticity and can result in slightly increased run times.
Brittle failure of the spotwelds occurs when:
n
m
 max ( f n, 0 )
 fs 
--------------------------------
 +  ≥1
Sn


 Ss 

where f n and f s are the normal and shear interface force. Component fn contributes
for tensile values only. When the failure time, t f , is reached the nodal rigid body
becomes inactive and the constrained nodes may move freely. In Figure 8-60 the
ordering of the nodes is shown for the 2 node and 3 node spotwelds. This order is
with respect to the local coordinate system where the local z-axis determines the
tensile direction. The nodes in the spotweld may coincide. The failure of the 3 node
spotweld may occur gradually with first one node failing and later the second node
may fail. For n noded spotwelds the failure is progressive starting with the outer
nodes (1 and n) and then moving inward to nodes 2 and n-1. Progressive failure is
necessary to preclude failures that would create new rigid bodies.

points as its primary superelement. The exterior grid points of the image
superelement must have the same relative location to each other as do the
corresponding points of the primary superelement. The global coordinate
directions of each exterior grid point of the image superelement must have
the same relative alignment as those of the corresponding grid points of the

then the tolerance may be adjusted with PARAM,CONFAC or DIAG 37.

Remarks:
1. Element ID numbers must be unique with respect to all other element ID
numbers.
2. The topology of the diagram must be preserved, i.e., G1, G2, G3 define a
triangular face; G1, G8, and G4 are on the same edge, etc.
3. The edge points, G5 to G10, are optional. Any or all of them may be deleted.
If the ID of any edge connection point is left blank or set to zero, the
equations of the element are adjusted to give correct results for the reduced
number of connections. Corner grid points cannot be deleted. The element
is an isoparametric element in all cases.
4. Components of stress are output in the material coordinate system except for
hyperelastic elements, which are output in the basic coordinate system.
5. For nonhyperelastic elements, the element coordinate system is derived
from the three vectors R, S, and T, which join the midpoints of opposite
edges.
R vector joins midpoints of edges G1-G2 and G3-G4.
S vector joins midpoints of edges G1-G3 and G2-G4.
T vector joins midpoints of edges G1-G4 and G2-G3.
The origin of the coordinate system is located at G1. The element coordinate
system is chosen as close as possible to the R, S, and T vectors and points in
the same general direction. (Mathematically speaking, the coordinate
system is computed in such a way that, if the R, S, and T vectors are described
in the element coordinate system, a 3x3 positive definite symmetric matrix
would be produced.)

force depends on the element type.

• For CTRIA3 elements, which are not p-elements and not hyperelastic,
the reference coordinate system for output is the element coordinate
system.

• For CTRIA3 elements referenced by a PSET of PVAL entry, the
stresses, strains and element forces are output in the local tangent
plane of the element. The local tangents are oriented in a user defined
direction which is uniform across a set of elements. By default, the
local tangent x-direction is oriented in the positive x-direction of the

Remarks:
1. CWELD defines a flexible connection between two surface patches, between
a point and a surface patch, or between two shell vertex grid points. See
Figure 8-72 through Figure 8-76.
2. Grid point GS defines the approximate location of the connector in space. GS
is projected on surface patch A and on surface patch B. The resulting piercing
points GA and GB define the axis of the connector. GS must have a normal
projection on surface patch A and B. GS does not have to lie on the surface
patches. GS is ignored for format “ALIGN”. GA is used instead of GS if GS
is not specified. For the formats “ELPAT” and “PARTPAT,” if GS and GA are
not specified, then XS, YS, and ZS must be specified.

3. The connectivity between grid points on surface patch A and grid points on
surface patch B is generated depending on the location of GS and the cross
sectional area of the connector. Diagnostic print outs, checkout runs and non
default settings of search and projection parameters are requested on the
SWLDPRM Bulk Data entry. It is recommended to start with the default
settings.
4. The format “PARTPAT” defines a connection of two shell element patches A
and B with PSHELL property identification numbers PIDA and PIDB,
respectively. The two property identification numbers must be different, see
Figure 8-72. Depending on the location of the piercing points GA, GB and the
size of the diameter D, the number of connected elements per patch ranges
from a single element up to 3x3 elements. The diameter D is defined on the
PWELD property entry.

5. The definition of the piercing grid points GA and GB is optional for all
formats with the exception of the format “ALIGN”. If GA and GB are given,
GS is ignored. If GA and GB are not specified, they are generated from the
normal projection of GS on surface patches A and B. For the formats
“ELEMID” and “GRIDID,” internal identification numbers are generated for
GA and GB starting with 101e+6 by default. The offset number can be
changed with PARAM,OSWPPT. If GA and GB are specified, they must lie

on or at least have a projection on surface patches A and B, respectively. The
locations of GA and GB are corrected so that they lie on surface patches A
and B within machine precision accuracy. The length of the connector is the
distance of grid point GA to GB.
6. The format “ELPAT” defines a connection of two shell element patches A
and B with shell element identification numbers SHIDA and SHIDB, see
Figure 8-72. The connectivity is similar to the format “PARTPAT”.
Depending on the location of the piercing points GA, GB and the size of the
diameter D, the number of connected elements per patch may range from a
single element up to 3x3 elements.
7. The format “ELEMID” defines a connection of two shell element patches A
and B with shell element identification numbers SHIDA and SHIDB, see
Figure 8-73. The connectivity is restricted to a single element per patch
regardless of the location of GA, GB and regardless of the size of the diameter
of the connector. In addition, the format “ELEMID” can define a point to
patch connection if SHIDB is left blank, see Figure 8-74. Then grid GS is
connected to shell SHIDA.

Remarks:
1. The displacement coordinate system (see CD field on GRID entry) for a grid
point lying on the axis of symmetry must be a rectangular system with the
z-component of motion aligned with the axis of symmetry. The positive axis
of symmetry is defined so that the azimuthal angle from positive side 1 to
side 2 of a segment is in the same direction as the angle from T1 to T2 for the
axis point. This is consistent with left- or right-hand rule.
2. If the dihedral symmetry option (STYPE = “DIH” on the CYSYM entry) is
selected, the y-axis must be perpendicular to side 1.
3. Grid points lying on the axis of symmetry may be constrained by SPCs but
not by MPCs. If the number of segments is three or more, SPCs must be
applied to both components 1 and 2 or to neither, and SPCs must be applied
to both components 4 and 5 or to neither in order to satisfy symmetry. In
addition, the degrees-of-freedom (not constrained by SPCs, if any) at these
grid points must be in the analysis set (a-set). If all degrees-of-freedom of
grid points on the axis of symmetry are constrained by SPCs (including heat
transfer, where there is only one degree-of-freedom), the grid point should
not be listed on the CYAX entry.

Remarks:
1. CYJOIN entries are used only for cyclic symmetry problems. The CYSYM
entry must be used to specify rotational, dihedral, or axisymmetry.
2. For rotational or axisymmetry problems, there must be one logical entry for
SIDE = 1 and one for SIDE = 2. The two lists specify grid points to be
connected; therefore, both lists must have the same length.
3. For dihedral problems, side 1 refers to the boundary between segments and
side 2 refers to the middle of a segment. For dihedral and/or AXI type of
symmetry, the grid point degree-of-freedom that is normal to the boundary
must be specified in field 3 as “T1", “T2", or “T3" (“R”, rectangular, and “C”,
cylindrical, are the same as “T2" while “S”, spherical, is the same as “T3").
For scalar and extra points with one degree-of-freedom, these should be
specified as blank, “T2", or “T3" if they are to have the same sign, and “T1",
if the two connected points are to be opposite in sign.

CYJOIN

1217

Cyclic Symmetry Boundary Points

4. All components of displacement at boundary points are connected to
adjacent segments except those constrained by SPCi, MPC, or OMITi entries.
5. The points on the axis of symmetry of the model, defined in the CYAX entry
must not be defined as a side 1 or side 2 point by means of this entry.
6. The word “THRU” may not appear in fields 4 or 9 of the parent entry and
fields 2 or 9 on the continuation entries.
7. All grid points that are implicitly or explicitly referenced must be defined.
8. For rotational and axisymmetry problems, the displacement coordinate
systems must be consistent between sides 1 and 2. This is best satisfied by
the use of a spherical or cylindrical coordinate system.

Remarks:
1. Components of motion defined on this entry may not appear on SPC, SPC1,

dependent degrees-of-freedom.
2. Supports are applied at the grid point identified in field 2 to prevent rigid
body motions in static analysis, or to define rigid body modes in eigenvalue
analysis. All degrees-of-freedom should be at a single grid point. In other
words, there can only be one such supported grid point in the model. The
supports are applied only to the cyclic components of order k=0 or k=1. In
order to satisfy conditions of symmetry, certain restrictions are placed on the
location of the grid point and the orientation of its displacement coordinate
system, as shown in the following table:

d. Any location except on the axis of symmetry or on side 2.
e. If the grid point is on the axis of symmetry, the displacement coordinate
system must be rectangular.
3. If the number of segments, N, is 1 (in the case of DIH symmetry) or 2 (in the
case of ROT or AXI symmetry), it is important that the rotational
components referenced in field 3 be elastically connected to the structure. If
N > 2 (in the case of DIH symmetry) or N > 3 (in the case of ROT or AXI
symmetry), it is not important, because in this case the supports for rigid
body rotation are actually applied to translational motions.
4. If N > 3, supports will be applied to both the 1 and 2 (inplane-translational)
components, if either is referenced, and to both the 4 and 5 (out-of-plane
rotational) components, if either is referenced. If component 6 is supported,
component 2 should not appear on OMIT or OMIT1 entries.
5. The restrictions noted in Remarks 2. and 4. are related to symmetry
requirements. For N > 3, symmetry requires that the supports be
symmetrical (or antisymmetrical), with respect to any plane passing through
the axis of symmetry. For the DIH options, N = 1 and N = 2, symmetry
requires that the supports be symmetrical (or antisymmetrical) with respect
to the plane(s) of symmetry. For the ROT option, N = 2, symmetry requires
that a support be either parallel or perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.
6. GID must be a grid point and not a scalar point.

4. In dynamic analysis, DAREA entries may be used with LSEQ Bulk Data
entries if LOADSET is specified in Case Control. The LSEQ and static load
entries will be used to internally generate DAREA entries.
5. If DAREA is referenced by a GUST entry, Pi must be defined. However, it is
only used if selected through a DLOAD Case Control command. WG from
the GUST entry is used instead of Ai when requested via a GUST entry.
6. All DAREA entries corresponding to all grid and scalar points are
automatically converted internally by the program to equivalent
FORCE/MOMENT/SLOAD entries (as appropriate) if there are no LSEQ Bulk
Data entries.

7. In superelement analysis, DAREA may be used to specify loads not only on
the interior points of the residual, but also on the interior points of upstream
superelements if there are no LSEQ Bulk Data entries.
8. In static analysis, DAREA entries may be used only if there are no LSEQ Bulk
Data entries. They are ignored if there are any LSEQ Bulk Data entries.

response defined on the DRESPi entry. If RID refers to an “EIGN” response,
then the imposed bounds must be expressed in units of eigenvalue,
(radian/time)2. If RID refers to a “FREQ” response, then the imposed

7. As Remark 6. indicates, small values of UALLOW and LALLOW require
special processing and should be avoided. Bounds of exactly zero are
particularly troublesome. This can be avoided by using a DRESP2 entry that
offsets the constrained response from zero.
8. LOWFQ and HIGHFQ fields are functional only for RTYPE with a ‘FR’ or a
‘PSD’ prefix, e.g., FRDISP or on DRESP2 or DRESP3 entries that inherit the
frequency value from these RTYPES. The bounds provided in LALLOW and
UALLOW are applicable to a response only when the value of forcing
frequency of the response falls between the LOWFQ and HIGHFQ. If the
ATTB field of the DRESP1 entry is not blank, LOWFQ and HIGHFQ are
ignored.
9. LID and UID are optional inputs that identify tabular input to specify the
lower and upper bounds as a function of frequency. They are applicable to
the response identified in Remark 8.

is the list of all the variable names (except variable-i) that appear in all
expressions. Variable-i may be used in subsequent expressions. The last

2. EQUATION may contain embedded blanks. EQUATION must contain less
than 32,000 nonblank characters. If more characters are required for use with
a DRESP2 entry, the DRESP2 can be divided into two or more DRESP2
entries with a master DRESP2 referencing subsequent DRESP2s.
3. The syntax of the expressions follows FORTRAN language standards. The
allowable arithmetic operations are shown in Table 8-4 in the order of
execution precedence. Parenthesis are used to change the order of
precedence. Operations within parentheses are performed first with the
usual order of precedence being maintained within the parentheses.

6. If the DEQATN entry is referenced by the GMLOAD, GMBC, TEMPF,
GMCURV, or GMSURF entries and your computer has a short word length
(e.g., 32 bits/word), then EQUATION is processed with double precision
and constants may be specified in double precision; e.g., 1.2D0. If your
machine has a long word length (e.g., 64 bits/word) then EQUATION is
processed in single precision and constants must be specified in single
precision; e.g., 1.2. If the DEQATN entry is referenced by DRESP2,
DVCREL2, DVMREL2 or DVPREL2 entries, constants must be specified in
single precision regardless of your machine’s word length.
7. The DMAP logical operators NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and XQV cannot be used
as Xi names.
8. Input errors on the DEQATN entry often result in poor messages.
Substituting a “[” for a parenthesis or violating the restriction against large

after constraints are applied. Load matrices may be selected by
P2G = NAME for dynamic and superelement analyses.
2. The header entry containing IFO, TIN and TOUT is required. Each nonnull
column is started with a GJ, CJ pair. The entries for each row of that column
follows. Only nonzero terms need be entered. The terms may be input in
arbitrary order. A GJ, CJ pair may be entered more than once, but input of
an element of the matrix more than once will produce a fatal message.

3. Field 3 of the header entry must contain an integer 0.
4. For symmetric matrices (IFO = 6), a given off-diagonal element may be input
either below or above the diagonal. While upper and lower triangle terms
may be mixed, a fatal message will be issued if an element is input both
below and above the diagonal.

nastran

5. The recommended format for rectangular matrices requires the use of NCOL
and IFO = 9. The number of columns in the matrix is NCOL. (The number
of rows in all DMIG matrices is always either p-set or g-set size, depending
on the context.) The GJ term is used for the column index. The CJ term is
ignored.

FMS

6. If NCOL is not used for rectangular matrices, two different conventions are
available:

1
2
3
EXEC

• If IFO = 9, GJ and CJ will determine the sorted sequence, but will
otherwise be ignored; a rectangular matrix will be generated with the
columns submitted being in the 1 to N positions, where N is the
number of logical entries submitted (not counting the header entry).

• If IFO = 2, the number of columns of the rectangular matrix will be
equal to the index of the highest numbered non-null column (in
internal sort). Trailing null columns of the g- or p-size matrix will be
truncated.

4A
4B
CASE

OUTPUT

4C
X-Y PLOT

7. The matrix names must be unique among all DMIGs.
8. TIN should be set consistent with the number of decimal digits required to
read the input data adequately. For a single-precision specification on a
short-word machine, the input will be truncated after about eight decimal
digits, even when more digits are present in a double-field format. If more
digits are needed, a double precision specification should be used instead.
However, note that a double precision specification requires a “D” type
exponent even for terms that do not need an exponent. For example, unity
may be input as 1.0 in single precision, but the longer form 1.0D0 is required
for double precision.
9. On long-word machines, almost all matrix calculations are performed in
single precision and on short-word machines, in double precision. It is
recommended that DMIG matrices also follow these conventions for a
balance of efficiency and reliability. The recommended value for TOUT is 0,
which instructs the program to inspect the system cell that measures the

value. TOUT = 0 allows the same DMIG input to be used on any machine. If
TOUT is contrary to the machine type specified (for example, a TOUT of 1 on
a short-word machine), unreliable results may occur.
10. If any DMIG entry is changed or added on restart then a complete re-analysis
is performed. Therefore, DMIG entry changes or additions are not
recommended on restart.

1. DMIG,UACCEL is an optional entry when PARAM,INREL,-1 is specified in
SOLs 101 or 200. If DMIG,UACCEL is present, the loads applied to the
structure are the sum of the conventional applied loads plus the inertia loads
resulting from the rigid body accelerations defined on this entry. If it is not
present, conventional inertia relief calculations are performed.
2. The load sequence number interpretation depends on the value of the NCOL
field. The recommended method is to set it equal to the number of loading
conditions. The load sequence number L is then the sequence number of the
subcase to which the applied acceleration will be applied.
3. The grid point identification number listed on Gi defines a single grid point
on the model where loads will be applied to cause the enforced acceleration
state. Gi must also appear on a SUPORT Bulk Data entry. It must also
appear on a PARAM,GRDPNT entry. In superelement analysis, it must be a
residual structure point exterior to all superelements.
4. The Xi value is the enforced acceleration at grid point Gi. The translation and
rotation components are in consistent units and will be applied in the basic
coordinate system regardless of the displacement coordinate system
specified for Gi (CD field on GRID entry).
5. Only nonzero terms need be entered.

1. Matrices defined on this entry are referenced in static aeroelastic analysis by
reference on AEDW and/or AEPRESS entries. In that paradigm, a single
column is required. Also, DMIJ may also be used for the W2GJ and FA2J
entries. Again, a single column is required. If both DMI and DMIJ are
specified for W2GJ or FA2J, the DMI entry will be used. DMI may NOT be
used for AEDW and AEPRESS.
2. The js-set DOF’s for each aerodynamic theory are limited to the six-DOF
paradigm (3 translations and 3 rotations). However, particular DOF’s are
permanently SPC’d based on the theory’s ability to support those degrees-offreedom. Unlike the DMIG entry, DMIJ data will be partitioned to the j-set,

6. The recommended format for rectangular matrices requires the use of NCOL
and IFO = 9. the number of columns in the matrix is NCOL. (The number of

9. TIN should be consistent with the number of decimal digits required to read
the input data adequately. For a single precision specification on a short
word machine, the input will be truncated after about eight decimal digits,
even when more digits are present in a double field format. If more digits are
needed, a double precision specification should be used instead. However,
not that a double precision specification requires a “D” type exponent even
for terms that do not need an exponent. For example, unity may be input as
1.0 in single precision, but the longer form 1.0D0 is required for double
precision.
10. On long word machines, almost all matrix calculations are performed in
single precision and, on short word machines, in double precision. It is
recommended that DMIJ matrices also follow these conventions for a
balance of efficiency and reliability. The recommended value for TOUT is 0,
which instructs the program to inspect the system cell that measures the
machine precision at run time and sets the precision of the matrix to the same
value. TOUT = 0 allows the same DMIJ input to be used on any machine. If
TOUT is contrary to the machine type specified, unreliable results may
occur.
11. If any DMIJ entry is changed or added on restart then a complete reanalysis
is performed. Therefore, DMIJ entry changes or additions are not
recommended on restart.

under Table 2 (Element Force Item Codes) in “Item Codes” on page 779.
Only force item codes that refer to failure indices of direct stress and
interlaminar shear stress are valid.
The CFAILURE and CSTRAT response types requires the following
specifications on the applicable entries:

• Failure theory in the FT field on PCOMP entry.
• Allowable bonding shear stress in the SB field on PCOMP entry.
• Stress limits in the ST, SC, and SS fields on all MATi entries.
3. ATTB can be used for responses of weight composite laminae, dynamics, real
and complex eigenvalues, and stability derivatives. For other responses, this
field must be blank.
4. All grids associated with a DRESP1 entry are considered to be in the same
region for screening purposes. Only up to NSTR displacement constraints
(see DSCREEN entry) per group per load case will be retained in the design
optimization phase.
5. DRESP1 identification numbers must be unique with respect to DRESP2
identification numbers.
6. If PTYPE = "ELEM", the ATTi correspond to element identification numbers.
7. If RTYPE = "DISP", “SPCFORCE”, “GPFORCE”, "TDISP", "TVELO",
"TACCL" or "TSPCF", multiple component numbers (any unique
combination of the digits 1 through 6 with no embedded blanks) may be
specified on a single entry. Multiple response components may not be used
on any other response types.
8. If RTYPE = "FRDISP", "FRVELO", "FRACCL", or "FRSPCF" only one
component number may be specified in the ATTA field. Numbers 1 through
6 correspond to real (or magnitude) components and 7 through 12 imaginary
(or phase) components. If more than one component for the same grid is
desired, then a separate entry is required.
9. Real/imaginary representation is the default for complex response types.
Magnitude/phase representation must be requested by the corresponding
Case Control command; e.g., DlSP(PHASE) = ALL for FRDISP type
responses.

10. REGION is used for constraint screening. The NSTR field on DSCREEN
entries gives the maximum number of constraints retained for each region
per load case.
IF RTYPE = "WEIGHT", "VOLUME", "LAMA", "EIGN", "FREQ", “CEIG”,
“TOTSE”, “RMSDISP”, “RMSVELO”, “RMSACCL”, no REGION
identification number should be specified. If the region field is left blank for
a grid response, one region is created for each DRESP1 ID. If the region field
is left blank for an element response, one region is created for each property
ID invoked. Usually, the default value is appropriate.
If the REGION field is not blank, all the responses on this entry as well as all
responses on other DRESP1 entries that have the same RTYPE and REGION
identification number will be grouped into the same region.
11. REGION is valid only among the same type of responses. Responses of
different types will never be grouped into the same region, even if they are
assigned the same REGION identification number by the user.
12. If RTYPE = "WEIGHT", "VOLUME", or “TOTSE” field ATTi = "ALL" implies
total weight/volume/total strain energy of all superelements except
external superelements, 0 implies residual only and i implies SEID=i.
Default="ALL”
13. RTYPE = "STABDER" identifies a stability derivative response. ATTB is the
restraint flag for the stability derivative. ATTB = 0 means unrestrained, and
ATTB = 1 means restrained. For example, ATTA = 4000, ATTB = 0, and
ATT1 = 3 reference the unrestrained Cz derivative for the AESTAT (or
AESURF) entry ID = 4000.
14. RTYPE = "FLUTTER" identifies a set of damping responses. The set is
specified by ATTi:
ATT1 = Identification number of a SET1 entry that specifies a set of modes.
ATT2 = Identification number of an FLFACT entry that specifies a list of
densities.
ATT3 = Identification number of an FLFACT entry that specifies a list of
Mach numbers.
ATT4 = Identification number of an FLFACT entry that specifies a list of
velocities.
If the flutter analysis is type PKNL, it is necessary to put PKNL in the PTYPE
field of this entry.

15. For RTYPE = "FRXXXX", “PSDXXXX” and “PRES” a real value for ATTB
specifies a frequency value in cycles per unit time. If a real ATTB value is
specified, then the responses are evaluated at the closest excitation
frequency. The default for ATTB is all excitation frequencies. See Remark 20.
for additional ATTB options. The OFREQ Case Control command has no
affect on the selection of the frequencies.
16. For RTYPE = "TDISP", "TVELO", "TACCL", "TSPCF", "TFORC", and
"TSTRE", ATTB specifies a time value. If ATTB is specified, then the
responses are evaluated at the closest time selected by the OTIME command.
The default for ATTB is all time steps selected by the OTIME command.
17. Intermediate station responses on CBAR elements due to PLOAD1 and/or
CBARAO entries may not be defined on the DRESP1 entry.
18. RTYPE = "EIGN" refers to normal modes response in terms of eigenvalue
(radian/time)**2 while RTYPE = "FREQ" refers to normal modes response in
terms of natural frequency or units of cycles per unit time.
19. For RTYPE = LAMA, EIGN or FREQ, the response approximation used for
optimization can be individually selected using the ATTB field when
APRCOD = 1 is being used.
For RTYPE = LAMA, ATTB = blank or 1 selects direct linearization, ATTB =
2 = inverse linearization.
For RTYPE = EIGEN or FREQ, ATTB = blank = Rayleigh Quotient
Approximation, = 1 = direct linearization, = 2 = inverse approximation.

DRESP1,10,DX1,FRSTRE,ELEM,,3,AVG,10
yields a response which is equal to the average stress for element 10 across
all forcing frequencies. NOTE: that the response computed is considered a
type 2 response. Therefore, if referenced on a DRESP2, the ID of such
DRESP1 (ATTB with character input) must be listed following DRESP2
keyword.
21. Element strain energy item codes can be found under Table 6-5 in “Element
Strain Energy Item Codes” on page 843 in Appendix A. Only element strain
energy and element strain energy density can be referenced on a DRESP1
entry.
22. For RTYPE=RMSDISP, RMSVELO, or RMSACCL the ATTB specifies the
appropriate RANDPS ID.
23. Input other than 1 or 7 of ATTA field, acoustic pressure component, for PRES

24. Design response weight is obtained from Grid Point Weight Generator for a
reference point GRDPNT (see parameter GRDPNT). If GRDPNT is either not
defined, equal to zero, or not a defined grid point, the reference point is taken
as the origin of the basic coordinate system. Fields ATTA and ATTB refer to
the row and column numbers of the rigid body weight matrix, which is
partitioned as follows:

The default values of ATTA and ATTB are 3, which specifies weight in the Z
direction. Field ATT1 = “ALL” implies total weight of all superelements
except external superelements. SEIDi refers to a superelement identification
number. SEIDi = “0” refers to the residual superelement. The default of
ATT1 is blank which is equivalent to “ALL”.
25. For RTYPE = GPFORCE, the PTYPE field is used to designate the GRID ID
at which the force is defined. Output that is produced using
PARAM NOELOF > 0 is not supported for the DRESP1 entry.
26. For RTYPE = GPFORCP, the PTYPE field is blank. The grid point force is for
the sum of all elements from the GRID ID listed in ATTA to the GRID (orient
ID) listed in ATTi. This response corresponds to that produced with
PARAM NOELP > 0. It is not necessary to set PARAM NOELP > 0 to
compute the GPFORCP response.
27. For RTYPE = PSDXXXX, the PTYPE field specifies the RANDPS ID.

2. a) If the referenced DRESP1 entries span subcases, the DRSPAN Case
Control command is required to identify DRESP1 ID’s for each subcase.
DRESP2 entries that span subcases must be invoked above the subcase level
by DESGLB on DESOBJ commands.
b) Referenced DRESP entries that span superelements are supported
automatically.
c) Referenced DRESP2 entries cannot span subcases or superelements.
3. DRESP2 entries must have unique identification numbers with respect to
DRESP1 entries.
4. The “DESVAR”, “DTABLE”, “DNODE”, “DVPREL1”, “DVCREL1” and
“DVMREL1”, “DVPREL2”, DVCREL2”, “DVMREL2”, and "DRESP2" flags
in field 2 must appear in the order given above. Any of these words, along
with the identification numbers associated with them, may be omitted if they
are not involved in this DRESP2 relationship. However, at least one of these
ten types of arguments must exist.
5. The REGION field follows the same rules as for the DRESP1 entries. DRESP1

they are assigned the same REGION identification number. The default is to
put all responses referenced by one DRESP2 entry in the same region.

When EQID has character input, the DEQATN entry is no longer needed.
The functions are applied to all arguments on the DRESP2 regardless of the
type. See Remark 20. of the DRESP1 entry for an explanation of these
functions.
9. The number of arguments of a DEQATN can be more than the number of
values defined on the DRESP2 if the DRESP1s referenced have RTYPE with
‘FR’ or ‘PSD’ prefix. Arguments are still positional. The extra arguments in
the DEQATN must appear at the end of the argument list. The discrepancy
is resolved internally with the forcing frequency(ies) associated with
DRESP1s. An example is shown as follows:

frequency (in hertz) of the first DRESP1 ID on the DRESP2. The second

C 2 sets the initial value of the maximum constraint created by this process.
The default values of 0.005 is equal to DOPTPRM parameter GMAX.
C 3 is an offset value to avoid dividing by zero when creating constraints.

Remarks:
1. DRESP3 entries may reference DESVAR, DTABLE, DRESP1, DNODE,
DVPREL1, DVCREL1, DVMREL1, DVPREL2, DVCREL2, DVMREL2 and
DRESP2 entries. However, a DRESP3 entry cannot reference another DRESP3
entry.
2. The group name must be referenced by an FMS CONNECT entry.
3. Multiple types of external responses can be defined in one group. Each type
name identifies a specific external response evaluated in the user-supplied
routines. See “Building and Using the Sample Programs” on page 251 of the
MSC.Nastran 2004 Installation and Operations Guide for a discussion of how to
incorporate external responses.

DRESP3

4. a) Referenced DRESP2 entries cannot span subcases or superelements.
b) If referenced DRESP1 entries span subcases, the DRSPAN Case Control
command is required to identify the DRESP1 ID’s for each subcase. DRESP3
entries that span subcases must be invoked above the subcase level by
DESGLB or DESOBJ commands.
c) Referenced DRESP1 entries that span superelements are supported
automatically.
5. DRESP3 entries must have unique identification numbers with respect to
DRESP2 and DRESP1 entries.
6. The “DESVAR”, “DTABLE”, “DNODE”, “DVPREL1”, “DVCREL1” and
“DVMREL1", “DVPREL2”, DVCREL2”, “DVMREL2”, “DRESP2”, and
“USRDATA” keywords on the continuation entries must appear in the order
given above. Any of these words, along with the subsequent data associated
with them, may be omitted if they are not involved in this DRESP3
relationship. However, at least one of these types of arguments must exist.
7. The REGION field follows the same rules as for the DRESP1 entries. DRESP1
and DRESP3 responses will never be contained in the same region, even if
they are assigned the same REGION identification number. The default is to
put all responses referenced by one DRESP3 entry in the same region.
8. The data in the USRDATA field is character string based. It provides a
convenient way to pass constants to the external response server routines.
The maximum number of characters allowed is 32000.

Remarks:
1. Grid responses associated with one particular load case are grouped by the
specification of DRESP1 entries. From each group, a maximum of NSTR
constraints are retained per load case.
2. Element responses are grouped by the property; i.e., all element responses
for one particular load case belonging to the set of PIDs specified under ATTi
on a DRESPi entry are regarded as belonging to the same region. In
superelement sensitivity analysis, if the property (PID) is defined in more
than one superelement, then separate regions are defined. A particular
stress constraint specification may be applied to many elements in a region
generating many stress constraints, but only up to NSTR constraints per load
case will be retained.
3. For aeroelastic responses, that is RTYPE = “TRIM”, “STABDER”, and
“FLUTTER”, the NSTR limit is applied to all DRESP1 ID’s that are the same
RTYPE and have the same REGION specified.
4. For responses that are not related to grids or elements, that is
RTYPE = WEIGHT”, “VOLUME”, “EIGN”, “FREQ”, “LAMA”, CEIG”, and
TOTSE”, NSTR is not used. TRS is still applicable.

Design Constraint Screening Data

5. The RTYPE field is set to EQUA if constraints that are associated with
DRESP2 entries are to be screened. The RTYPE field is set to DRESP3 if
constraints that are associated with DRESP3 entries are to be screened. If the
REGION field on the DRESP2 or DRESP3 is blank, one region is established
for each DRESP2/DRESP3 entry.
6. If a certain type of constraint exists but no corresponding DSCREEN entry is
specified, all the screening criteria used for this type of constraint will be
furnished by the default values.
7. Constraints can be retained only if they are greater than TRS. See the
Remarks under the “DCONSTR” on page 1225 entry for a definition of
constraint value.
8. Constraint screening is applied to each superelement.

3. The entry using IREC = 0 is called the header entry and is an optional entry.
The values T1 through T6 go to a special record called the trailer. Other

entry or the trailer is not specified, T1 through T6 = 32767. On this entry,
“ENDREC” may be used only if there is at least one continuation.
4. In addition to the optional header entry, there must be one logical entry for
each record in the table. Null records require no entries.
5. “ENDREC” is used to input blank values at the end of a record. If
“ENDREC” is not specified, the string for a record ends with the last
nonblank field.
6. The maximum number of DMI and DTI data blocks is 1000.

Stress, Strain and/or Force Sort/Filter Item Code Override

Remarks:
1. This table is recognized only in SOLs 101, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114,
115, 144, 153, and for stress quantities only. One or more of the user
parameters S1, S1G, or S1M must be specified with a value greater then or
equal to zero in order to request sorting and/or filtering. See user parameter
S1 in “Parameters” on page 603. In order to sort force or strain quantities, a
DMAP Alter is required.
2. If the Ci value is -1, the element type will be suppressed on the output file.
An example of this feature could be as follows: If an element type is to be
sorted on two different values and output twice, this can be accomplished by
two calls to the STRSORT module with two unique DTI tables. However,
other element types will be printed twice. This additional print can be
suppressed by setting their sort codes to -1.
3. Table 8-11 lists the elements currently that are sortable. In addition, the
element type identification number, the default stress output quantity, and
the associated stress code identification numbers are provided. If this entry
is not specified, then the stresses are sorted based on the default quantity
given in Table 8-11.

b. The stress code identification number is merely the word number in the
standard printed output for the stress quantity of interest. For example,
the thirteenth word of stress output for the CHEXA element is the
octahedral shear stress. For this element type, the element identification
number and the grid point ID each count as a separate word. Stress codes
for the elements are tabulated in “Item Codes” on page 779.

Remarks:
1. The variables identified by DVIDi and LABLi correspond to variable names
(x1, x2, etc.) listed in the left-hand side of the first equation on the DEQATN
entry identified by EQID. The variable names x1 through xN (where
N = m+n) are assigned in the order DVID1, DVID2, ..., DVIDn, LABL1,
LABL2, ..., LABLm.
2. If both “DESVAR” and “DTABLE” are specified in field 2, “DESVAR” must
appear first.
3. FID may be either a positive or a negative number. If FID > 0, it identifies the
field position on a property entry. If FID < 0, it identifies the word position
of an entry in EPT. For example, to specify the area of a PBAR, either
PNAME=A, FID = +4 or FID = -3 may be used. In general, use of PNAME is
recommended.
4. TYPE = “PBEND” is not supported. TYPE=”PBARL” or “PBEAML” support
only PNAME and not FID.
5. Designing PBEAM requires specification of both property name and station.

Remarks:
1. The EIGB entry must be selected with the Case Control command
METHOD = SID.
2. Each eigenvalue is the factor by which the prebuckling state of stress is
multiplied to produce buckling in the shape defined by the corresponding
eigenvector.
3. The continuation entry is optional. If the continuation is not specified, than
NORM = “MAX” normalization is performed.
4. See The Nastran Theoretical Manual, Sections 10.3.6 and 10.4.2.2, for a
discussion of convergence criteria.
5. If NORM = “MAX”, components that are not in the analysis set may have
values larger than unity.
6. The SINV method is an enhanced version of the INV method. It uses Sturm
sequence techniques to ensure that all roots in the range have been found. It
is generally more reliable and more efficient than the INV method.
7. Convergence is achieved at 10

–6

.

8. For buckling solutions, the Lanczos algorithm is most reliable if it is allowed
to compute the lowest mode first, then the remainder in increasing order of
magnitude. The lowest mode is usually the mode of most interest. If the F1
and F2 fields are left blank (for EIGRL, L1 and L2 on EIGB) an estimate of the
first mode eigenvalue is found by a robust, efficient inverse iteration. If ND
is set to 1 (on EIGRL; NDN and NDP on EIGB) there is a high probability that
the first mode will be computed reliably. If more modes are needed it is
easier to fill out the other fields correctly once the location of the lowest mode
is known.

The word “force” above implies that the method selected by the system cell
will be used even when another method has been selected on an EIGC entry.
Sums of these values will produce two or more actions at once, when
feasible. As the numbers get larger, the function is more developer-oriented
than user-oriented.
2. When using METHOD = "HESS", the following should be noted:

4A
4B
CASE

OUTPUT

4C
X-Y PLOT

The "HESS" method is generally more reliable and economical for small and
moderate-size problems. It computes ND eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
3. The EIGC entry may or may not require continuations as noted below.

• For the "HESS" method, continuations are not required; and their
contents are ignored when present, except for ND1. However, it is
recommended that continuations are not used.

• For the "CLAN" method when the continuation entry is not used a

5
PARAM

shift is calculated automatically. When a shift is input on the first
continuation entry it is used as the initial shift. Only one shift is used.
Data on other continuation entries is ignored.

• For METHOD = "INV", each continuation defines a rectangular

6
CODES

search region. Any number of regions may be used and they may
overlap. Roots in overlapping regions will not be extracted more than
once.

• For all methods, if no continuation is present, then ND0 must be

specified on the first entry. If a continuation is present, then NDj must
be specified on the continuation and not on the first entry.
4. The units of ALPHAAJ, OMEGAAJ, ALPHABJ, and OMEGABJ are radians
per unit time.
5. See The NASTRAN Theoretical Manual, Sections 10.4.4.5 and 10.4.4.6, for a
discussion of convergence criteria and the search procedure with the INV
method.

EIGC

6. DIAG 12 prints diagnostics for the inverse power method, the complex
Lanczos method and the QZ HESS method.
7. If METHOD = "HESS" and the LR or QR methods (non-default methods) are
selected by system cell 108 the mass matrix must be nonsingular. The default
QA method does not require a nonsingular mass matrix.
8. The normalized eigenvectors may be output with the SDISPLACEMENT
and/or DISPLACEMENT Case Control commands.
9. When using METHOD = CLAN, the following should be noted. The
modern CLAN method (default for METHOD entry of CLAN) has been
enhanced to include a block complex Lanczos approach. This method is
more reliable and will not accept inaccurate roots which the old method had
a tendency to do. Thus, given the same input, the new method may often
accept fewer roots. For continuity the old method has been maintained and
may be selected by setting SYSTEM(108).
10. The SVD method is provided for DMAP applications. If used in solution 107
or 110, and mass or damping terms are present, a user fatal exit is taken. See
the MSC Web site for the Flight Loads Product examples on the use of the
SVD method. The SVD operation decomposes the input stiffness matrix K
into the factors U, S, and V. U and V are collections of vectors of orthogonal
functions. S is a rectangular matrix with terms on the diagonal of its left
partition. The factors satisfy the equation K = U*S*V’, where “ ’ ” implies
complex conjugate transpose. The ND1 value has a meaning for the SVD
functions which differs from eigensolution.
ND1

OUTPUT

>0

All vectors of U and V are output.

=0

U and V are returned in a purged state.

<0

S is returned as a square matrix whose number of
columns is equal to the minimum number of rows or
columns of the input matrix. U and V are truncated
to be commensurate with S. This is a method to
reduce the costs of solving very rectangular input
matrices by providing a partial solution for the most
interesting vectors.

11. For DMAP applications there are input parameters, not present in the
solution sequences, that may be used to replace the function of the EIGC and
CMETHOD entries. See the MSC.Software Web site for details.

both small- and large-size problems. It takes advantage of sparsity of input
matrices, leading to greater efficiency on large-size problems. Because
Lanczos performance is tuned for medium to large problems, this has caused
difficulties with very small problems. Thus, by default, on problems with
fewer than 20 degrees-of-freedom when the LAN method is selected, the
method is switched to AHOU. The criteria for automatic switching is
controlled by SYSTEM(359) on the NASTRAN entry. The NE, G, and C fields
are ignored for the LAN method. The NORM field may be set to MASS (the
default value) or NORM. The conventions used when both the Fi and ND
fields are specified are described in Table 1 of the EIGRL entry description.
The EIGRL entry is an alternate method to select the LAN method. It has
several other input options for special cases. When both and EIGRL and
EIGR have the same SID and that SID is selected by a METHOD command
the EIGRL entry takes precedence.
7. The AHOU method is competitive with the LAN method when there are
small, dense matrices and many eigenvectors are required. This most
commonly occurs when static or dynamic reduction is performed. The
AHOU method does not take advantage of matrix sparsity, so that
computation cost rises with the cube of the number of DOFs. The AHOU
method responds to all permitted values for all the other fields except NE,
which is ignored.
8. All methods require a positive semi-definite (psd) mass matrix for stable
solutions. The mass matrix may be tested for this condition for all methods
of solution by setting SYSTEM(303). A value of “-4” should be sufficient to
identify problem matrices. A fatal error exit is taken when it is not met. All
MSC.Nastran metric elements are designed to produce psd mass matrices.

EIGR

Real Eigenvalue Extraction Data

CMASSi elements, DMIG matrices selected by the M2GG command, and
matrices input via INPUTT4 are special methods that allow addition of nonpsd terms by use of non-metric element input. If none of this type of special
input is present and the fatal error exit is taken you may have encountered
an error in a metric element. Contact your local MSC technical representative
for corrective action in this case.
9. The LAN and AHOU methods allow singular but positive semi-definite
mass matrices.
10. The tridiagonal methods include the xGIV and xHOU methods, where “x” is
described in the following comments. All tridiagonal methods compute all
eigenvalues, and the number of eigenvectors specified by the Fi and Nd
fields, as described in Table 13.

11. If “x” is blank (for example, the HOU method is selected) the mass matrix
must be non-singular.
12. If “x” is M (for example, the MHOU method is selected) the mass matrix may
be singular. A modified, shifted problem is solved in an inverse basis with
this method. Some precision in the solution and longer computation time is
exchanged for a more stable solution.
13. If “x” is A (for example, the AHOU method is selected) an attempt is made
to solve the problem without shifting, in the interest of cost reduction and
maximum precision. If the mass matrix is determined to be poorly
conditioned for inversion the basis is automatically shifted with the
modified method.
14. If NORM = “MAX”, components that are not in the analysis set may have
values larger than unity.
15. If NORM = “POINT”, the selected component should be in the analysis set
(a-set). (The program uses NORM = “MAX” when it is not in the analysis
set.) The displacement value at the selected component will be positive or
negative unity.
16. The “SINV” method is an enhanced version of the “INV” method. It uses
Sturm sequence number techniques to make it more likely that all roots in
the range have been found. It is generally more reliable and more efficient
than the “INV” method.
17. For the “INV” and “SINV” methods, convergence is achieved at 10
Convergence is tested by other criteria for the other methods.

18. For the “SINV” method only, if F2 is blank, the first shift will be made at F1,
and only one eigensolution above F1 will be calculated. If there are no modes
below F1, it is likely that the first mode will be calculated. If there are modes
below F1 (including rigid body modes defined by SUPORT entries), a mode
higher than the first mode above F1 may be calculated.
19. When F1, F2, and ND are all zero or blank, ND is reset to 1. A User Warning
Message is produced for this condition, which is interpreted as likely to be
due to an inadvertent omission by the user.
20. For buckling solutions, the Lanczos algorithm is most reliable if it is allowed
to compute the lowest mode first, then the remainder in increasing order of
magnitude. The lowest mode is usually the mode of most interest. If the F1
and F2 fields are left blank (for EIGRL, L1 and L2 on EIGB) an estimate of the
first mode eigenvalue is found by a robust, efficient inverse iteration. If ND
is set to 1 (on EIGRL; NDN and NDP on EIGB) there is a high probability that
the first mode will be computed reliably. If more modes are needed it is
easier to fill out the other fields correctly once the location of the lowest mode
is known.
21. F2 must be specified if DOMAINSOLVER ACMS or DOMAINSOLVER
MODES is also specified in the Executive Control Section.

Remarks:
1. Real eigenvalue extraction data sets must be selected with the Case Control

2. The units of V1 and V2 are cycles per unit time in vibration analysis, and are
eigenvalues in buckling analysis. Each eigenvalue is the factor by which the
prebuckling state of stress is multiplied to produce buckling in the shape
defined by the corresponding eigenvector.
3. NORM = “MASS” is ignored in buckling analysis and NORM = “MAX” will
be applied.
4. The roots are found in order of increasing magnitude; that is, those closest to
zero are found first. The number and type of roots to be found can be
determined from Table 8-16.

5. In vibration analysis, if V1 < 0.0, the negative eigenvalue range will be
searched. (Eigenvalues are proportional to Vi squared; therefore, the
negative sign would be lost.) This is a means for diagnosing improbable
models. In buckling analysis, negative V1 and/or V2 require no special
logic.
6. Eigenvalues are sorted on order of magnitude for output. An eigenvector is
found for each eigenvalue.
7. MSGLVL controls the amount of diagnostic output during the eigenvalue
extraction process. The default value of zero suppresses all diagnostic
output. A value of one prints eigenvalues accepted at each shift. Higher
values result in increasing levels of diagnostic output.
8. MAXSET is used to limit the maximum block size. It is otherwise set by the
region size or by ND with a maximum size of 15. It may also be reset if there
is insufficient memory available. The default value is recommended.
9. In vibration analysis, if V1 is blank, all roots less than zero are calculated.
Small negative roots are usually computational zeroes which indicate rigid
body modes. Finite negative roots are an indication of modeling problems.
If V1 is set to zero, negative eigenvalues are not calculated.
10. A specification for SHFSCL may improve performance, especially when
large mass techniques are used in enforced motion analysis. Large mass
techniques can cause a large gap between the rigid body and flexible
frequencies. If this field is blank, a value for SHFSCL is estimated
automatically.
11. On occasion, it may be necessary to compute more roots than requested to
ensure that all roots in the range have been found. However, this method
will not output the additional roots.

13. For the distributed parallel method, the frequency range between V1 and V2
may be subdivided into segments that can then be analyzed in parallel. V1
and V2 must be specified for the parallel method. NUMS must be specified
greater than 1 to take advantage of the parallel method. NUMS may also be
specified on the NUMSEG keyword of the NASTRAN statement. Currently,
NUMSEG must equal the number of processors and by default NUMSEG is
set to the number of processors requested by the DMP keyword. If both are
specified, then NUMS takes precedence.
The upper frequencies of each segment may be generated automatically by
ALPH or specified directly in Fi. If both are specified, then Fi takes
precedence over ALPH as long as they are consistent. ALPH if multiplied by
100 may also be specified on FRQSEQ keyword of the NASTRAN statement.
14. Increasing MAXSET may improve performance for large problems where a
large number of eigenvalues are being found. The default is 7 on all
machines except CRAY which is 12. SYSTEM(263) may be set in an rcfile to
effectively modify the default; however the setting on the EIGRL entry
always takes precedence.
15. SYSTEM(196), keyword SCRSAVE, controls reuse of scratch files when
segment logic is invoked. SYSTEM(196) is useful only when multiple
frequency segments are requested on a Lanczos run. (Multiple frequency
segments can be requested via the NUMS field in the EIGRL entry and by
SYSTEM(197).) Each frequency segment requires a minimum of three
scratch files. When multiple frequency segments are used on a single
processor computer then each frequency segment is solved serially. In this
case, it makes sense to let segment #2 use the scratch files which were used
by segment #1 since work for segment #1 has been completed (otherwise it

EIGRL

1355

Real Eigenvalue Extraction Data, Lanczos Method

wouldn’t be working on #2). Similarly, when work for segment #2 is
finished, segment #3 should be able to use #2’s scratch files. SYSTEM(196)=1
allows such file reuse and is considered a safe default on Version 70 and later
systems.
16. The new buckling shift logic in Version 70.5 tends to shift to 1.0 first. The
logic may have difficulty finding the lowest ND roots if a problem requests
a small number of roots (ND) when there are thousands of roots below 1. In
this case either the loading should be scaled, SHFSCL specified, or a smaller
frequency range requested.
17. Because Lanczos performance is tuned for medium to large problems, this
has caused difficulties with very small problems. Thus, by default, on
problems with fewer than 20 degrees-of-freedom when the LAN method is
selected, the method is switched to AHOU. The criteria for automatic
switching is controlled by SYSTEM(359) on the NASTRAN entry.
18. V2 must be specified if DOMAINSOLVER ACMS or DOMAINSOLVER
MODES is also specified in the Executive Control Section.

Remarks:

2. The density is given by DENS ⋅ RHOREF , where RHOREF is the reference
value specified on the AERO entry and DENS is the density ratio specified
on the FLFACT entry.
3. The reduced frequency is given by k = ( REFC ⋅ ω ⁄ 2 ⋅ V ) , where REFC is
given on the AERO entry, ω is the circular frequency, and V is the velocity.
If k = 0.0 , as specified on the FLFACT entry, then only the K-method may
be specified and the Inverse Power method of eigenvalue extraction (INV on
the EIGC entry) must be used. Aeroelastic divergence analysis is more
appropriately performed using one of the “PKx” methods.

4. For the PK and PKNL methods, an eigenvalue is accepted when:
k – k estimate < EPS

for k estimate < 1.0

k – k estimate < EPS ⋅ k estimate

for k estimate ≥ 1.0

5. When one of the “PKx” methods is selected, physical displacements will
only be generated for the velocities on the FLFACT that are specified as
negative values of the requested velocity. Also, structural damping as
specified on the GE field of MATi entries is ignored.
6. If IMETH = “L”, a linear interpolation is performed on reduced frequencies
at the Mach numbers specified on the FLFACT entry using the MKAEROi
entry Mach number that is closest to the FLFACT entry Mach number. For
IMETH = “S”, a surface interpolation is performed across Mach numbers
and reduced frequencies. For the “PKx” methods, linear interpolation is
always performed.
7. For the “K”, “KE”, “PK”, and “PKS” methods, all combinations of the
FLFACT entry are analyzed. For the “PKNL” and “PKNLS” methods, only
ordered pairs are analyzed; i.e., ( ρ 1, M 1, V 1 ), ( ρ 2, M 2, V 2 )… ( ρ n, M n, V n ) .
For the PKNL and PKNLS methods, equal number of densities, Mach
numbers and velocities must be specified.

optimization.

each set of modes within the bounds 20 and 2000, plus 10 frequencies
between 20 and the lowest mode in the range, plus 10 frequencies between
the highest mode in the range and 2000.
4. Since the forcing frequencies are near structural resonances, it is important
that some amount of damping be specified.

6. CLUSTER is used to obtain better resolution near the modal frequencies
where the response varies the most. CLUSTER > 1.0 provides closer spacing
of excitation frequency towards the ends of the frequency range, while
values of less than 1.0 provide closer spacing towards the center of the
frequency range. For example, if the frequency range is between 10 and 20,
NEF = 11, TYPE = "LINEAR"; then, the excitation frequencies for various
values of CLUSTER would be as shown in Table 8-18.

Excitation frequencies may be based on natural frequencies that are not

are within the range. Similarly, an excitation frequency calculated based on
natural frequencies within the range (F1 through F2) may be excluded if it
falls outside the range.
5. The frequency spread can be used also to define the half-power bandwidth.
The half-power bandwidth is given by 2 ⋅ ξ ⋅ fN , where ξ is the damping
ratio. Therefore, if FSPD is specified equal to the damping ratio for the mode,
NFM specifies the number of excitation frequency within the half-power
bandwidth. See Figure 8-84 for the definition of half-power bandwidth.

1. GMBC is the recommended entry for specifying boundary conditions and
must be selected with Case Control command SPC = SPCID.
2. LID and SPCID refer to Case Control commands for specifying loads and
boundary conditions. Whenever there are several nonzero enforced motion
vectors supplied, the most efficient processing of the data (single
decomposition of the stiffness matrix) is accomplished by specifying both
LID and SPCID.

3. Acceleration or gravity loads may be combined with “simple loads” (e.g.,
FORCE, MOMENT) only by specification on a LOAD entry. That is, the SID

4. In the static solution sequences, the load set ID must be selected by the Case
Control command LOAD = SID. In the dynamic solution sequences, SID
must be referenced in the LID field of an LSEQ entry, which in turn must be
selected by the Case Control command LOADSET.

5. At most nine GRAV entries can be selected in a given run either by Case
Control or the LOAD Bulk Data entry. Multiples or reflections of a given
acceleration or gravity load can be economically accomplished by use of the
LOAD Bulk Data entry.
6. In cyclic symmetry solution sequences, the T3 axis of the coordinate system
referenced in field 3 must be parallel to the axis of symmetry. In dihedral
cyclic symmetry (where STYPE = “DIH” on the CYSYM entry), the T1 axis
must, in addition, be parallel to Side 1 of segment 1R of the model.

9. The RFORCE entry may be used to specify rotational accelerations.
10. The coordinate systems in the main Bulk Data Section are defined relative to

3. The collection of all CD coordinate systems defined on all GRID entries is
called the global coordinate system. All degrees-of-freedom, constraints,
and solution vectors are expressed in the global coordinate system.
4. The SEID field can be overridden by use of the SESET entry.
5. If CD = -1, then this defines a fluid grid point in coupled fluid-structural
analysis (see “Additional Topics” on page 529 of the MSC.Nastran Reference
Guide). This type of point may only connect the CAABSF, CHACBR,
CHACAB, CHEXA, CPENTA, and CTETRA elements to define fluid
elements.
6. A zero (or blank if the GRDSET entry is not specified) in the CP and CD fields
refers to the basic coordinate system.
7. In p-version analysis, the hierarchy set to resolve the conflicts arising in the
global system input data is described under Remark 10 of the GMBC entry
description.
8. CID can reference GMCORD type coordinate systems only when the GRID
is connected to p-version elements.

3. L1 and L2 may reference LOAD entries. However, the LOAD entry in such
a case must not reference load sets defined via RFORCE and/or GRAV
entries.
4. If L1 refers to a set ID defined by SPCD loading entry, the same ID must not
reference any nonzero loading specified by the other Bulk Data loading
entries given via FORCE, MOMENT, FORCE1, MOMENT1, FORCE2,
DAREA (if these entries have been converted), MOMENT2, PLOAD,
PLOAD1, PLOAD2, PLOAD4, PLOADX1, and SLOAD entries. In other
words, an enforced deformation loading via the SPCD entry is specified by
a load set ID L1 or L2 and a zero magnitude loading via a load (such as
FORCE) with the same ID.

7. S must be nonzero. In addition, either S1 or S2 must be nonzero.
8. L1 and L2 may reference any of the static or dynamic loading entries except
GRAV and RFORCE.

zero harmonic loads may be applied so the LOADCYH entry should be used.

Remarks:

2. The number of static load vectors created for each superelement depends
upon the type of analysis. In static analysis, the number of vectors created is
equal to the number of unique EXCITEID IDs on all LSEQ entries in the Bulk
Data; in dynamic analysis, the number of vectors created is equal to the
number of unique EXCITEID IDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1,
TLOAD2 and ACSRCE entries in the Bulk Data.
3. EXCITEID may be referenced by CLOAD, RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1,

Selects Data Recovery Output

Remarks:
1. MARCOUT is only available when MSC.Marc is executed from within
MSC.Nastran and controls what results are available in the MSC.Marc t16
file. All elements or nodes of each type selected will be placed on the t16 file
(in other words, it is not possible to control this output by selecting various
sets). The results in the t16 file may be used to obtain op2, xdb, punch or f06
results output by specifying OUTR options on the SOL 600 executive control
entry. Thus, op2, xdb, punch and f06 results can not be controlled using sets.
See remarks 9 to 11 for other related information.
2. Values such as E1, E21 correspond to MSC.Marc’s postcodes 1 and 21,
respectively.
3. Outputs produced by MARCOUT are the same for all subcases, load steps,
iterations, etc.
4. The MARCOUT entry may be repeated as many times as desired, or all
entries may be placed on continuation lines.
5. For entries E1, E11 and E21 corresponding entries E2-E7, E12-E17 and E22E27 will be generated automatically. These terms correspond to 3 normal
stress (or strain) and 3 shear stress/strain values plus the equivalent von
Mises value. See MSC.Marc volume C POST description for more details.
6. If this entry is not used, the following defaults are entered automatically: E1,
E11, E18, E21, E301, E321, E341, E401, N1, N2, N5, N35, N37, N39. When
creep or heat transfer is present, additional items are added appropriately. If
the MARCOUT entry is entered, only those items specified will be output.
7. At present, only displacements, rotations, Cauchy stresses and one type of
strains (total, plastic or elastic) may be transferred to the MSC.Nastran
database. In subsequent releases, it is anticipated that the MSC.Nastran
database will be expanded to allow all of the output listed previously.

Results for all other output media are controlled by the MARCOUT and SOL
600 OUTR entries. Normally, results in the Marc .out file are not desired and

11. TREF is used in two different ways:

• In nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106), TREF is used only for the
calculation of a temperature-dependent thermal expansion
coefficient. The reference temperature for the calculation of thermal
loads is obtained from the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) set selection.
See Remark 10 in the MAT1 description.

• In all SOLs except 106, TREF is used only as the reference temperature
for the calculation of thermal loads. TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) may
be used for this purpose, but TREF must be blank.
12. If PARAM,W4 is not specified, GE is ignored in transient analysis. See
“Parameters” on page 603.
13. PCOMP entries generate MAT2 entries equal to 100,000,000 plus the PCOMP
PID. Explicitly specified MAT2 IDs must not conflict with internally
generated MAT2 IDs. Furthermore, if MID is greater than 400,000,000 then
A1, A2, and A3 are a special format. They are [ G4 ] ⋅ [ α4 ] not [ α4 ] . If MIDs
larger than 99999999 are used, PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 must be specified to
obtain stress output.
14. In nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106) the QUAD4, TRIA3, QUADR, and
TRIAR thermal loads are computed using the secant (default) method. To
use the more accurate integral method, specify
‘PARAM,EPSILONT,INTEGRAL’ in bulk data. See “Parameters” on
page 603.
15. Negative values for ST, SC, and SS lead to no margins of safety being
computed.

LS-Dyna Material #12 – This is a very low cost isotropic plasticity model for threedimensional solids. In the plane stress implementation for shell elements, a one-step
radial return approach is used to scale the Cauchy stress tensor if the state of stress
exceeds the yield surface. This approach to plasticity leads to inaccurate shell
thickness updates and stresses after yielding. This is the only model in LS-DYNA for
plane stress that does not default to an iterative approach. Used in MSC.Nastran

Constants for a variety of materials are provided in [Johnson and Cook 1983]. A fully
viscoplastic formulation is optional (VP) which incorporates the rate equations within
the yield surface. An additional cost is incurred but the improvement is results can be
dramatic.

Due to nonlinearity in the dependence of flow stress on plastic strain, an accurate value of the
flow stress requires iteration for the increment in plastic strain. However, by using a Taylor
series expansion with linearization about the current time, we can solve for σy with sufficient
accuracy to avoid iteration.

reaches the value of 1.
A choice of three spall models is offered to represent material splitting, cracking, and
failure under tensile loads. The pressure limit model limits the minimum hydrostatic
pressure to the specified value, p ≥ p min . If pressures more tensile than this limit are
calculated, the pressure is reset to p min . This option is not strictly a spall model since
the deviatoric stresses are unaffected by the pressure reaching the tensile cutoff and
the pressure cutoff value p min remains unchanged throughout the analysis. The
maximum principal stress spall model detects spall if the maximum principal stress,
σ max , exceeds the limiting value σ p . Once spall is detected with this model, the
deviatoric stresses are reset to zero and no hydrostatic tension is permitted. If tensile
pressures are calculated, they are reset to 0 in the spalled material. Thus, the spalled
material behaves as rubble. The hydrostatic tension spall model detects spall if the
pressure becomes more tensile than the specified limit, p min . Once spall is detected, the
deviatoric stresses are set to zero and the pressure is required to be compressive. If
hydrostatic tension is calculated then the pressure is reset to 0 for that element.

In addition to the above failure criterion, this material model also supports a shell
element deletion criterion based on the maximum stable time step size for the element,
∆t max . Generally ∆t max , goes down as the element becomes more distorted. To assure
stability of time integration, the global LS-DYNA time step is the minimum of the
∆t max values calculated for all elements in the model. Using this option allows the
selective deletion of elements whose time step has fallen below the specified
minimum time step, ∆t crit . Elements which are severely distorted often indicate that
material has failed and supports little load, but these same elements may have very
small time steps and therefore control the cost of the analysis. This option allows these
highly distorted elements to be deleted from the calculation, and, therefore, the
analysis can proceed at a larger time step, and, thus, at a reduced cost. Deleted
elements do not carry any load, and are deleted from all applicable slide surface
definitions. Clearly, this option must be judiciously used to obtain accurate results at
a minimum cost.
Material type 15 is applicable to the high rate deformation of many materials
including most metals. Unlike the Steinberg-Guinan model, the Johnson-Cook model
remains valid down to lower strain rates and even into the quasistatic regime. Typical
applications include explosive metal forming, ballistic penetration, and impact.

If these load curve ID's are input as 0, then the constant values specified in the input

Note: All load curves used to define quantities as a function of strain rate must have the
same number of points at the same strain rate values. This requirement is used to
allow vectorized interpolation to enhance the execution speed of this
constitutive model.
This model also contains a simple mechanism for modeling material failure. This
option is activated by specifying a load curve ID defining the effective stress at failure
as a function of strain rate. For solid elements, once the effective stress exceeds the
failure stress the element is deemed to have failed and is removed from the solution.

For shell elements the entire shell element is deemed to have failed if all integration
points through the thickness have an effective stress that exceeds the failure stress.
After failure the shell element is removed from the solution.
In addition to the above failure criterion, this material model also supports a shell
element deletion criterion based on the maximum stable time step size for the element,
∆t max . Generally, ∆t max goes down as the element becomes more distorted. To assure
stability of time integration, the global LS-DYNA time step is the minimum of the
∆t max values calculated for all elements in the model. Using this option allows the
selective deletion of elements whose time step ∆t max has fallen below the specified
minimum time step ∆t crit . Elements which are severely distorted often indicate that
material has failed and supports little load, but these same elements may have very
small time steps and therefore control the cost of the analysis. This option allows these
highly distorted elements to be deleted from the calculation, and, therefore, the
analysis can proceed at a larger time step, and, thus, at a reduced cost. Deleted
elements do not carry any load, and are deleted from all applicable slide surface
definitions. Clearly, this option must be judiciously used to obtain accurate results at
a minimum cost.

The rigid material type 20 provides a convenient way of turning one or more parts
comprised of beams, shells, or solid elements into a rigid body. Approximating a
deformable body as rigid is a preferred modeling technique in many real world
applications. For example, in sheet metal forming problems the tooling can properly
and accurately be treated as rigid. In the design of restraint systems the occupant can,

MATD020 (SOL 700)

1531

LS-Dyna Material #20 -- Rigid Material

for the purposes of early design studies, also be treated as rigid. Elements which are
rigid are bypassed in the element processing and no storage is allocated for storing
history variables; consequently, the rigid material type is very cost efficient.
Two unique rigid part ID's may not share common nodes unless they are merged
together using the rigid body merge option. A rigid body may be made up of disjoint
finite element meshes, however. SOL 700 assumes this is the case since this is a
common practice in setting up tooling meshes in forming problems.
All elements which reference a given part ID corresponding to the rigid material
should be contiguous, but this is not a requirement. If two disjoint groups of elements
on opposite sides of a model are modeled as rigid, separate part ID's should be created
for each of the contiguous element groups if each group is to move independently.
This requirement arises from the fact that LS-DYNA internally computes the six rigid
body degrees-of-freedom for each rigid body (rigid material or set of merged
materials), and if disjoint groups of rigid elements use the same part ID, the disjoint
groups will move together as one rigid body.
Inertial properties for rigid materials may be defined in either of two ways. By default,
the inertial properties are calculated from the geometry of the constituent elements of
the rigid material and the density specified for the part ID. Alternatively, the inertial
properties and initial velocities for a rigid body may be directly defined, and this
overrides data calculated from the material property definition and nodal initial
velocity definitions.
Young's modulus, E, and Poisson's ratio, ν are used for determining sliding interface
parameters if the rigid body interacts in a contact definition. Realistic values for these
constants should be defined since unrealistic values may contribute to numerical
problem in contact.
Constraint directions for rigid materials (CMO equal to +1 or -1) are fixed, that is, not
updated, with time.
If no constraints are specified for the rigid part (CMO=0) the nodes for the part are
scanned to determine constraints on the part in global directions. If constraints are
specified (CMO equal to +1 or -1) then the nodes are not scanned.
For coupling with MADYMO 5.4.1, only basic coupling is available.

LS-Dyna Material #22 -- Orthotropic Material with
Brittle Failure

MATD022 (SOL 700)

Used to model an orthotropic material with optional brittle failure for composites. It
can be defined following the suggestion of (Chang and Chang 1987a, 1987b). Three
failure criteria are possible. By using the user defined integration rule, the constitutive
constants can vary through the shell thickness. For all shells, except the DKT
formulation, laminated shell theory can be activated to properly model the transverse
shear deformation. Lamination theory is applied to correct for the assumption of a
uniform constant shear strain through the thickness of the shell. For sandwich shells
where the outer layers are much stiffer than the inner layers, the response will tend to
be too stiff unless lamination theory is used. Used in MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear
(SOL 700) only.

Load curve ID or Table ID. Load curve ID defining effective stress versus

The table ID defines for each strain rate value a load curve ID giving the
stress versus effective plastic strain for that rate, See Figure 8-98. The
stress versus effective plastic strain curve for the lowest value of strain
rate is used if the strain rate falls below the minimum value. Likewise,
the stress versus effective plastic strain curve for the highest value of
strain rate is used if the strain rate exceeds the maximum value. The
strain rate parameters: C and P; the curve ID, LCSR; EPS1-EPS8 and ES1ES8 are ignored if a Table ID is defined. (Real; Default = 0)

Note:

The strain rate values defined in the table may be given as the natural
logarithm of the strain rate. If the first stress-strain curve in the table
corresponds to a negative strain rate, LS-DYNA assumes that the natural
logarithm of the strain rate value is used. Since the tables are internally
discretized to equal space the points, natural logarithms are necessary,
for example, if the curves correspond to rates from 10.e-04 to 10.e+04.

The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bilinear stress strain curve by defining
the tangent modulus, ETAN. Alternately, a curve similar to that shown in Figure 8-98
is expected to be defined by (EPS1,ES1) -- (EPS8,ES8); however, an effective stress
versus effective plastic strain curve (LCSS) may be input instead if eight points are
insufficient. The cost is roughly the same for either approach. The most general
approach is to use the table definition (LCSS) discussed below.
Three options to account for strain rate effects are possible.
1. Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model
which scales the yield stress with the factor

input instead. In this curve the scale factor versus strain rate is defined.

3. If different stress versus strain curves can be provided for various strain
rates, the option using the reference to a table (LCSS) can be used.

incurred over the simple scaling but the improvement is results can be

Rate effects may be accounted for by defining a table of curves. If a table ID
is specified a curve ID is given for each strain rate. Intermediate values are
found by interpolating between curves. Effective plastic strain versus yield
stress is expected. If the strain rate values fall out of range, extrapolation is
not used; rather, either the first or last curve determines the yield stress
depending on whether the rate is low or high, respectively.

For efficiency, we recommend that the load curve identification numbers (LCA, LCB,
LCC, LCS, LCAB, LCBC, and LCCA) contain exactly the same number of points with
corresponding strain values on the abscissa. If this recommendation is followed the
cost of the table lookup is insignificant. Conversely, the cost increases significantly if
the abscissa strain values are not consistent between load curves.
The behavior before compaction is orthotropic where the components of the stress
tensor are uncoupled, i.e., an a component of strain will generate resistance in the local
a-direction with no coupling to the local b and c directions. The elastic moduli vary,
from their initial values to the fully compacted values at V f , linearly with the relative
volume V:

The relative volume, V , is defined as the ratio of the current volume to the initial
volume. Typically, V = 1 at the beginning of a calculation. The viscosity coefficient µ
(MU) should be set to a small number (usually in the range of .02-.10). Alternatively,
the two bulk viscosity coefficients on the control entries should be set to very small
numbers to prevent the development of spurious pressures that may lead to
undesirable and confusing results. The latter is not recommended since spurious
numerical noise may develop.
The load curves define the magnitude of the average stress as the material changes
density (relative volume), figure below. Each curve related to this model must have
the same number of points and the same abscissa values. There are two ways to define
these curves:
1. as a function of relative volume ( V ) .
2. as a function of volumetric strain defined as:
εV = ( 1 – V )

OUTPUT

In the former, the first value in the curve should correspond to a value of relative
volume slightly less than the fully compacted value. In the latter, the first value in the
curve should be less than or equal to zero, corresponding to tension, and increase to
full compaction.

Note: Care should be taken when defining the curves so that extrapolated values
do not lead to negative yield stresses.

At the beginning of the stress update each element’s stresses and strain rates are transformed

λ is either unity or a value taken from the load curve number, LCSR, that defines λ as a
function of strain-rate. Strain-rate is defined here as the Euclidean norm of the deviatoric strainrate tensor.

The load curve definition that provides the uniaxial data should give the change in gauge
length, ∆ L , versus the corresponding force. In compression both the force and the change in
gauge length must be specified as negative values. In tension the force and change in gauge
length should be input as positive values. The principal stretch ratio in the uniaxial direction,
λ 1 , is then given by
L 0 + ∆L
λ 1 = -------------------L0
with L 0 being the initial length and L being the actual length.
Alternatively, the stress versus strain curve can also be input by setting the gauge
length, thickness, and width to unity (1.0) and defining the engineering strain in place
of the change in gauge length and the nominal (engineering) stress in place of the force
(see the next figure).
The least square fit to the experimental data is performed during the initialization
phase and is a comparison between the fit and the actual input is provided in the

MATD054 (SOL 700)

LS-Dyna Material #54 -- Enhanced Composite Material
Model

This material is an enhanced version of the composite model material type 22.
Arbitrary orthothropic materials, e.g., unidirectional layers in composite shell
structures can be defined. Optionally, various types of failure can be specified
following either the suggestions of (Chang and Chang, 1984) or (Tsai and Wu, 1981).
In addition special measures are taken for failure under compression. See
(Matzenmiller and Schweizerhof, 1990). This model is only valid for thin shell
elements. The parameters in parentheses below apply only to solid elements and are
therefore always ignored in this material model. They are included for consistency
with materials MATD022 and MATD059. By using the user defined integration rule,
the constitutive constants can vary through the shell thickness. For all shells, except
the DKT formulation, laminated shell theory can be activated to properly model the
transverse shear deformation. Lamination theory is applied to correct for the
assumption of a uniform constant shear strain through the thickness of the shell. For
sandwich shells where the outer layers are much stiffer than the inner layers, the
response will tend to be too stiff unless lamination theory is used. Used in
MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 700) only.

2. If DFAILT is greater than zero, failure occurs if the tensile fiber strain is
greater than DFAILT or less than DFAILC.
3. If EFS is greater than zero, failure occurs if the effective strain is greater than
EFS.
4. If TFAIL is greater than zero, failure occurs according to the element
timestep as described in the definition of TFAIL above.
When failure has occurred in all the composite layers (through-thickness integration
points), the element is deleted. Elements which share nodes with the deleted element
become “crashfront” elements and can have their strengths reduced by using the
SOFT parameter with TFAIL greater than zero.
Information about the status in each layer (integration point) and element can be
plotted using additional integration point variables. The number of additional
integration point variables for shells written to the LS-DYNA database is input by
PARAM,DYNEIPS. For MATD054 and MATD055, these additional variables are

The compressive behavior is illustrated in figure below where hysteresis on unloading
is shown. This behavior under uniaxial loading is assumed not to significantly couple
in the transverse directions. In tension the material behaves in a linear fashion until
tearing occurs. Although the implementation may be somewhat unusual, it was
motivated by Storakers (1986).

MATD057 (SOL 700)

LS-Dyna Material #57 -- Highly Compressible Low Density Foams

The model uses tabulated input data for the loading curve where the nominal stresses
are defined as a function of the elongations, ε i , which are defined in terms of the
principal stretches, λ i , as:

1
nastran

εi = λi – 1
The stretch ratios are found by solving for the eigenvalues of the left stretch tensor, V ij ,
which is obtained via a polar decomposition of the deformation gradient matrix, F ij .
Recall that,

2
FMS

F ij = R ik U kj = V ik R kj
The update of V ij follows the numerically stable approach of (Taylor and Flanagan
1989). After solving for the principal stretches, we compute the elongations and, if the
elongations are compressive, the corresponding values of the nominal stresses, τ i are
interpolated. If the elongations are tensile, the nominal stresses are given by
τ i = Eε i
and the Cauchy stresses in the principal system become

3
EXEC

4A
4B
CASE

OUTPUT

τi
σ i = ---------λi λk
The stresses can now be transformed back into the global system for the nodal force
calculations.
Additional Remarks:
1. When hysteretic unloading is used the reloading will follow the unloading
curve if the decay constant, β , is set to zero. If β is nonzero the decay to the
original loading curve is governed by the expression:
1. – e

– βt

2. The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate dependent pressure, may cause an
unexpected volumetric response and, consequently, it is optional with this
model.
3. The hysteretic unloading factor results in the unloading curve to lie beneath
the loading curve as shown below. This unloading provide energy
dissipation which is reasonable in certain kinds of foam.
4. Note that since this material has no effective plastic strain, the internal
energy per iniitial volume is written into the output databases.

This model is effectively a Maxwell fluid which consists of a damper and
spring in series. We characterize this in the input by a Young's modulus, E d ,
and decay constant, β 1 .The formulation is performed in the local system of
principal stretches where only the principal values of stress are computed
and triaxial coupling is avoided. Consequently, the one-dimensional nature
of this foam material is unaffected by this addition of rate effects. The
addition of rate effects necessitates twelve additional history variables per
integration point. The cost and memory overhead of this model comes
primarily from the need to “remember” the local system of principal
stretches.

This material model follows a constitutive relationship of the form:
m∙n
σ = kε ε

where σ is the yield stress, ε is the effective plastic strain, ε∙ is the normalized effective
plastic strain rate, and the constants k, m, and n can be expressed as functions of
effective plastic strain or can be constant with respect to the plastic strain. The case of
no strain hardening can be obtained by setting the exponent of the plastic strain equal
to a very small positive value, i.e. 0.0001.
This model can be combined with the superplastic forming input to control the
magnitude of the pressure in the pressure boundary conditions in order to limit the
effective plastic strain rate so that it does not exceed a maximum value at any
integration point within the model.
A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional. An additional cost is incurred but the
improvement is results can be dramatic.

greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude. To model the rubber as an

The Ramberg-Osgood equations are inherently one-dimensional and are assumed to
apply to shear components. To generalize this theory to the multidimensional case, it
is assumed that each component of the deviatoric stress and deviatoric tensorial strain
is independently related by the one-dimensional stress-strain equations. A projection
is used to map the result back into deviatoric stress space if required. The volumetric
behavior is elastic, and, therefore, the pressure p is found by

Options include: BLANK, ORTHO, or RCDC.
Including ORTHO invokes an orthotropic damage model. It is implemented only for
shell elements with multiple through thickness integration points and is an extension
to include orthotropic damage as a means of treating failure in aluminum panels.
Directional damage begins after a defined failure strain is reached in tension and
continues to evolve until a tensile rupture strain is reached in either one of the two
orthogonal directions. After rupture is detected at all integration points, the element
is deleted. The option RCDC invokes the damage model developed by Wilkins
(Wilkins, et.al., 1977). A nonlocal formulation, which requires additional storage, is
used if a characteristic length is defined.

The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bilinear stress strain curve by defining
the tangent modulus, ETAN. Alternately, a curve similar to that shown in Figure 8105 is expected to be defined by (EPS1,ES1) - (EPS8,ES8); however, an effective stress
versus effective plastic strain curve (LCSS) may be input instead if eight points are
insufficient. The cost is roughly the same for either approach. The most general
approach is to use the table definition (LCSS) discussed below.

LS-Dyna Material #100 -- Material for Spot Weld

The material model applies to beam elements to solid elements with hourglass
control. The failure models apply to both beam and solid elements.
The beam elements, based on the Hughes-Liu beam formulation, may be placed
between any two deformable shell surfaces and tied with constraint contact which
eliminates the need to have adjacent nodes at spot weld locations. Beam spot welds
may be placed between rigid bodies and rigid/deformable bodies by making the node
on one end of the spot weld a rigid body node which can be an extra node for the rigid
body. In the same way rigid bodies may also be tied together with this spot weld
option. This weld option should not be used with rigid body switching.
In flat topologies the shell elements have an unconstrained drilling degree-of-freedom
which prevents torsional forces from being transmitted. If the torsional forces are
deemed to be important, brick elements should be used to model the spot welds.
Beam and solid element force resultants are written to the spot weld force file,
SWFORC, and the file for element stresses and resultants for designated elements in
file ELOUT.
Note: It is advisable to include all spot welds, which provide the slave nodes, and
spot welded materials, which define the master segments, within a single
interface for beam element spot welds or a CONTACT interface for solid
element spot welds.
As a constraint method these interfaces are treated independently which can lead to
significant problems if such interfaces share common nodal points. An added benefit
is that memory usage can be substantially less with a single interface.
Options include: BLANK and DAMAGE
The DAMAGE option also includes failure and causes one additional line to be read
with the damage parameter and a flag that determines how failure is computed from
the resultants. On this line the parameter, RS, if nonzero, invokes damage mechanics
combined with the plasticity model to achieve a smooth drop off of the resultant forces
prior to the removal of the spotweld. The parameter OPT determines the method used
in computing resultant based failure, which is unrelated to damage. Used in
MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 700) only.

LS-Dyna Material #100 -- Material for Spot Weld

Remarks:
The weld material is modeled with isotropic hardening plasticity coupled to four
failure models. The first model specifies a failure strain which fails each integration
point in the spot weld independently. The second model fails the entire weld if the
resultants are outside of the failure surface defined by:
 max ( N rr , 0 ) 2  N rs  2  N rt  2  M rr  2  M ss  2  M tt  2

where the numerators in the equation are the resultants calculated in the local
coordinates of the cross section, and the denominators are the values specified in the
input. If NF is nonzero the resultants are filtered before failure is checked. The stress
based failure model, which was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation and is based
on the peak axial and transverse shear stresses, fails the entire weld if the stresses are
outside of the failure surface defined by

None, either, or both of the failure models may be active depending on the specified
input values.
The inertias of the spot welds are scaled during the first time step so that their stable
time step size is ∆t . A strong compressive load on the spot weld at a later time may reduce
the length of the spot weld so that stable time step size drops below ∆t . If the value of ∆t is
zero, mass scaling is not performed, and the spotwelds will probably limit the time step size.
Under most circumstances, the inertias of the spot welds are small enough that scaling them
will have a negligible effect on the structural response and the use of this option is encouraged.
Spotweld force history data is written into the SWFORC ascii file. In this database the
resultant moments are not available, but they are in the binary time history database
and in the ASCII elout file.

4. The plastic deformation starts when the effective stress ( σ ) exceeds the yield
stress.
The yield stress is initially defined by the initial yield point, which is
subsequently modified by the hardening rule to account for strain
hardening. Under the isotropic hardening rule, the size of the yield surface
p
expands as a function of effective plastic strain ( ε ) . Under the kinematic
hardening rule, the center of the yield surface moves in stress space while
keeping the same size and shape. Ziegler’s law is used to define the
translation of the yield surface. Under the combined hardening, the initial
hardening is assumed to be entirely isotropic, but the elastic range attains a
constant value (i.e., behaving like kinematic hardening) after some plastic
straining. The effective stress for von Mises is expressed as

to prior rolling process, for which the plastic anisotropy is customarily
characterized by r-values defined by strain ratio measured in the uniaxial
tension, i.e.,

8. The elasticity constants must be isotropic for ORNL plasticity except for

curve in TID field should be a normalized function so that the yield stress at
zero plastic strain is unity.
9. The pressure-dependent yielding, based on Drucker-Prager yield criterion,
contains three options for frictional materials such as rocks and concrete. The
generalized Mohr-Coulomb criterion introduces linear and parabolic
models, developed by Drucker and Prager. The linear Mohr-Coulomb model
assumes a linear function of hydrostatic stress for a yield function, i.e.,

where β is a user-specified constant, γ is an internal parameter (set to 0.2)
with no user’s access, and Y is the yield stress.
The Buyukozturk concrete plasticity model is coupled with crack and crush
capability, which is designed for a low-tension material. The low-tension
material develops a crack in the perpendicular direction to the maximum
principal stress when it exceeds a critical value. The tension softening
modulus can be specified (in absolute value) by the user to process the
cracking process gradually. The default value (0.) is intended for a sudden
cracking with a complete loss of the stiffness upon cracking. After the initial
crack, a second crack can initiate in the perpendicular direction to the first
crack. Likewise, the third crack can be formed in 3D solid elements. The
loading may reverse the direction after the crack is formed. In this case, the
crack will close and some load carrying capacity is resumed. The
compression capability is fully resumed and the shear stresses may be
transmitted over the crack surface with a reduced stiffness by a factor
specified as shear retention factor. The material may fail in compression by
crushing. The input value for the crush strain is positive, which implies an
absolute value of a compressive strain. The material loses its integrity for
good upon crushing. The reinforcement bars may be simulated by adding
REBAR elements.
11. The Gurson model for porous metal plasticity may be used only with
isotropic hardening rule. All other hardening rules will be ignored if Gurson
model is selected. The Gurson model modified by Tvergaard and
Needleman is designed for porous metal plasticity with damage effects in
the ductile material. The material is assume to form voids under loading,
which grow, coalesce, then leads to crack formation and eventually failure.
This process is a function of hydrostatic stress and the void volume fraction
f v . The yield function is established as follows:

12. The evolution of damage as measured by void volume fraction is due to void
nucleation and void growth. Void nucleation occurs by debonding of the
second phase particles. The strain for nucleation depends on the particle
sizes. Assuming a normal distribution of particle sizes, the void nucleation
itself is modeled as a normal distribution in strains if nucleation is straincontrolled. If the void nucleation is assumed to be stress controlled in the
matrix, a normal distribution is assumed in stresses. The void volume
fraction changes due to the growth of existing voids and nucleation of new
voids, i.e.,
f∙v = f∙growth + f∙nucleation

the material

1. The MATF Bulk Data entry contains supplementary data for failure
prediction of the elastic materials with the same MID. If this capability is
used in nonlinear analysis, MATF will activate progressive failure process.
2. A progressive failure behavior for a linear elastic material is simulated by
MATF Bulk Data entry. Failure occurs when any one of the specified failure
criteria is satisfied. Upon failure, the elastic modulus reduces to 10% of the
original modulus if there is only one value of modulus as in isotropic
material or in a beam or truss element. If it pertains to an orthotropic
material, all of the material moduli at the integration point are reduced to the
lowest modulus specified. The behavior up to the failure point is linear
elastic even if an elasto-plastic material is specified, which is followed by a
nonlinear behavior for the post-failure analysis. If the initial yield stress is
less than the allowable maximum stress, the failure criteria will be ignored.
In case of the anisotropic material (MAT2, MATORT or MAT9), the
progressive failure cannot be applied because no apparent elastic modulus
exists in the material constants.
3. According to the Maximum Stress Criterion, the material fails when any of
the stress components (9 components including 6 normal stress components
in tension and compression, and three shear stress components) exceeds the
maximum allowable stress:
σ ij > Xt, Xc, Yt, …, S xy, …etc.

1. MATG defines nonlinear properties in the thickness direction for
compression only, designed for gasket-like materials. MATG has anisotropy
only in the thickness direction, which is called normal anisotropy. This
material is available only using the internal MSC.Marc translator
(SOLNINL).
2. The MATG entry defines the compressive behavior in thickness. The
thickness direction is the principal direction (3) in 3-dimensional solids and
(2) for 2-dimensional solids (plane strain and axisymmetric elements). Since
MATG material allows only normal anisotropy, linear properties in MAT1
are required for in-plane behavior.
3. The initial yield pressure should match a point in table TABLD.
4. The loading path for the gasket is always in compression. However, it starts
from the origin to initial yield pressure (nonlinear elastic range) and
continues with strain hardening slope into the plastic region. All the data
points are specified in the first quadrant.
5. As many as 10 unloading paths may be defined in the thickness direction
using TABLS1 in pressure vs. gasket closure distance as in the loading path.
All the unloading paths must start from zero pressure and end at the loading
path in the plastic region. Unloading behavior at undefined paths will be
interpolated between two adjacent unloading paths. The last point of the last
specified unloading path signifies full compression, which does not allow
any further closure beyond the point.

Damage Model Properties for Hyperelastic Materials

Remarks:
1. The MATHE Bulk Data entry with the same MID must exist for MATHED to
be effective.
The damage capability is available for all the elastomeric materials (MooneyRivlin, Ogden, Gent, Arruda-Boyce) based on the updated Lagrangian
formulation. It is also available based on the total Lagrangian formulation,
only for the Ogden model.
2. Under repeated application of loads, elastomers undergo damage by
mechanisms involving chain breakage, multi-chain damage, micro-void
formation, and micro-structural degradation due to detachment of filler
particles from the network entanglement. The damage model for elastomeric
materials is based on the undamaged strain energy function W 0 , multiplied
by a Kachanov damage factor, K, i.e.,
W = K ( α, β )W 0
where α and β are parameters for discontinuous and continuous damage
models, respectively. Two types of phenomenological models,
discontinuous and continuous, exist to simulate the damage. The
discontinuous damage model simulates the “Mullins’ effect,” which
involves a loss of stiffness (represented by a parameter α ) below the
previously attained maximum strain. The higher the maximum attained
strain the larger the loss of stiffness is. There is a progressive stiffness loss
with increasing maximum strain amplitude. Most of the stiffness loss takes
place in the first few cycles provided the maximum strain level is not
increased. This phenomenon is observed in both filled as well as natural
rubber although the higher level of carbon black particles increases the
hysteresis and the loss of stiffness. The continuous damage model (Miehe’s
formulation) can simulate the damage accumulation for strain cycles for
which the values of effective energy is below the maximum attained value of
the past history. The evolution of continuous damage parameter is governed
by the arc-length of the effective strain energy, represented by a
parameter β .

respectively; J = det F is the determinant of the deformation gradient; and
2D1 = K and 2 ( A10 + A01 ) = G at small strains, in which K is the bulk
modulus and G is the shear modulus. The model reduces to a
Mooney-Rivlin material if NA=1 and to a Neo-Hookean material if NA = 1
and A01 = 0.0. See Remark 2. For Neo-Hookean or Mooney-Rivlin materials
no continuation entry is required. T is the current temperature and T0 is the
initial temperature.
2. Conventional Mooney-Rivlin and Neo-Hookean materials are fully
incompressible. Full incompressibility is not presently available but may be
simulated with a large enough value of D1. A value of D1 higher than
3
10 ⋅ ( A10 + A01 ) is, however, not recommended.
3. Aij and Di are obtained from least squares fitting of experimental data. One
or more of four experiments (TAB1 to TAB4) may be used to obtain Aij. Di
may be obtained from pure volumetric compression data (TABD). If all
TAB1 through TAB4 are blank, Aij must be specified by the user. Parameter
estimation, specified through any of the TABLES1 entries, supercedes the
manual input of the parameters.
4. IF ND=1 and a nonzero value of D1 is provided or is obtained from
experimental data in TABD, then the parameter estimation of the material
constants Aij takes compressibility into account in the cases of simple
tension/compression, equibiaxial tension, and general biaxial deformation.
Otherwise, full incompressibility is assumed in estimating the material
constants.
5. See Chapters “Hyperelastic Elements” on page 220, “Hyperelastic

Isotropic Material Temperature Dependence

Remarks:
1. Fields 3, 4, etc., of this entry correspond, field-by-field, to fields 3, 4, etc., of
the MAT1 entry referenced in field 2. The value in a particular field of the
MAT1 entry is replaced or modified by the table referenced in the
corresponding field of this entry. In the example shown, E is modified by
TABLEMi 32, A is modified by TABLEMi 15, and ST is modified by
TABLEMi 52. Blank or zero entries mean that there is no temperature
dependence of the fields on the MAT1 entry.
2. Any quantity modified by this entry must have a value on the MAT1 entry.
Initial values of E, G, or NU may be supplied according to Remark 3 on the
MAT1 entry.
3. Table references must be present for each item that is temperature
dependent. For example, it is not sufficient to give table references only for
fields 3 and 4 (Young’s modulus and shear modulus) if Poisson’s ratio is
temperature dependent.
4. For a nonlinear static analysis of a composite element with the parameter
COMPMATT set to ON, if the TABLEMi ID for the coefficient of thermal
expansion is negative, the TABLEMi values will be interpreted as the
thermal strain ε ( T ) rather than the coefficient of thermal expansion α ( T ) .

Thermo-Elastic-Plastic Material Properties

2. The table represents yield stresses as a function of temperature. Therefore,
the curve should comprise the initial stress from Y0 or FID field on MATEP
(most likely at room temperature). T(Y0) field accommodates FID field in
case FID field defines the initial yield stress instead of Y0 field. In this case,
the yield stresses at any plastic strain will be scaled by the same ratio as the
initial yield stress at the same temperature.
3. The table represents a normalized plasticity moduli (work hardening slope)
as a function of temperature.
4. Temperature dependent stress-strain curves may be entered in a general
manner using the T(FID) option. The integer value entered in this field
represents the ID of a TABLEST entry which provides ID’s of TABLES1
stress-plastic strain curves vs. temperature. All such curves must be entered
as stress vs. plastic strain. No curves should be referenced on the MATS1
entry. For this option T(Y0) and T(H) should be left blank and if entered,
MSC.Nastran will re-set them to blank if T(FID) is a positive integer.

1. The MATTHE entry must have the same ID as the corresponding MATHE
entry. Each table ID on the MATTHE entry corresponds to a parameter on
the MATHE entry.
2. If the thermal expansion coefficient is temperature-dependent, the thermal
strain is computed as
ε th = α ( T – T ref ) – α 0 ( T 0 – T ref )
where T ref is the reference temperature at which measurement of the thermal
expansion coefficient is based, T 0 is an initial temperature, and α 0 is the
thermal expansion coefficient at the initial temperature T 0 . If the thermal
expansion is not temperature-dependent, the thermal strain expression is
reduced to the usual expression:
ε th = α ( T – T 0 )
3. If experimental data is provided, it is expected that the user has the data for
multiple tests of the same type at different temperatures. The T(TABi) fields
refer to TABLEST entries which in turn refer to TABLES1 entries for each
temperature. The TABLES1 entries contain the measured stress-strain curves
described under MATHE.

Remarks:
1. The MATVE or MATVORT Bulk Data entry with the same MID must exist
for MATTVE to be effective.
2. The viscoelastic behavior is especially noticeable in the organic high
polymers. There are many different kinds of such materials including
various plastics, natural and synthetic rubbers. Their mechanical properties
depend strongly on temperature, and these properties change drastically in
the vicinity of a critical temperature called the glass-transition temperature
T g . The polymer well below T g is an organic glass with a relatively high
modulus. The viscoelastic behavior predominates in the transition range
around T g . The polymer above the transition region (but below the melting
point) becomes a rubbery solid with a low modulus.

MATTVE (SOL 600)

1669

Thermo-Visco-Elastic Material Properties

Polymers are broadly classified as amorphous polymers and polycrystalline
polymers. Under stress-relaxation at a constant strain in the glass-transition
region temperature, the amorphous polymer exhibits a phase change over
time from the glassy state to the rubbery state. The response is manifested in
the shear modulus as a function of time, in which initially high shear
modulus changes into low shear modulus. The relaxation curve of the
modulus in a log-log scale plot appears as a flat plateau of glassy modulus
G g shifting down to the equilibrium modulus G e at the rubbery plateau.
Such a relaxation behavior of the amorphous polymer is observed even
when the temperature is well below T g for a prolonged period of time in a
very slow process. A similar behavior is found in the rubbery elastic region,
but the process is faster.
Fortunately, the mechanical properties of amorphous polymers obey a timetemperature superposition principle, which allows the use of data obtained
at different temperatures to extend the time scale at any given temperature.
For such a behavior, the amorphous polymer is characterized as thermorheologically simple (TRS). Since the relaxation process extends several
decades on the logarithmic time scale at lower temperatures, it is not feasible
to determine the whole curve by a constant strain test at one temperature.
Instead, the relaxation characteristics are measured at elevated temperatures
in reduced time scale. Then the polymers exhibit a translational shift of all
the characteristic responses with a change of temperature along the
logarithmic time axis. This shift occurs parallel to the time axis without a
change in properties: glassy and rubbery moduli. The modulus curve shifts
towards shorter time with an increased temperature.
3. The reduced ( ξ ), or pseudo, time is related to the actual time ( t ) through a
shift function which is a function of temperature, i.e.,
ξ(t) =

t

∫0

ds
-------------------A(T(s ))

where A ( T ) is a shift function in terms of temperature T at time t . The shift
function is a material property and must be determined experimentally. A
shift function approximated by Williams-Landell-Ferry, known as WLF
equation, has the form:
C1 ( T – T0 )
log A = h ( T ) = – -----------------------------------C2 + ( T – T0 )

MATVE (SOL 600)

Visco-Elastic Material Properties

2. The time-dependent behavior in the viscoelastic material is modeled by a
Prony series expression for both small and large strain problems. The stress
relaxation behavior can be modeled by relaxation functions of the shear
modulus and bulk modulus in terms of a series of exponential decay terms,
which is known as the Prony series. This is equivalent to the generalized
Maxwell model, which consists of many Maxwell models connected in
parallel along with an elastic spring representing a long-term behavior. The
constitutive behavior of viscoelasticity depends not only on the current state
of stress and strain, but also on the entire history of the development of these
states. Such a behavior is most readily expressed by hereditary or Duhamel
integral. The Prony series is a discrete form of this hereditary integral.
3. The Prony series defines the relaxation modulus by a dimensionless function
of time

The function is introduced to each stress-strain component, i.e.,

modulus, which would have settled the stress-strain relationship when the
time approaches infinity. In case of the volumetric deformation, the shear
modulus is replaced by a bulk modulus K to define the parameters with

Visco-Plastic or Creep Material Properties

Remarks:
1. This Bulk Data entry is activated if a MAT1, MAT2, MATORT, or MAT9
entry with the same MID is specified in a nonlinear analysis using
MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600) only. This creep capability is
available for isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic elasticity, which can be
coupled with plasticity using MATEP entry. Coupling with plasticity is
allowed only for selected plasticity models, which include von Mises, Hill’s
anisotropy (creep stays isotropic), and Mohr-Coulomb models. However,
viscoelasticity (MATVE) cannot be combined with viscoplasticity (MATVP).
2. The creep behavior of the material is expressed in terms of creep strain rate
as a product of a number of terms (functions of effective stress, equivalent
creep strain, temperature, and time) in either piece-wise linear curves or
exponential form, i.e.,
∙c

The functions f, g, h and K are specified as piece-wise linear functions in a
tabular form using TABLEM1 entry, if the Table Form is selected. Notice that
the last term in time shows function K for the equivalent creep strain in
terms of time, instead of creep strain rate.
The creep strain from the creep material is a permanent strain unlike the
creep strain for materials using the CREEP Bulk Data entry. As such, this
creep material may be classified as viscoplastic material. This creep
capability is provided for the primary and the secondary creep behavior,
because the tertiary creep involves material instability such as necking.
3. If the threshold stress is the same as the initial yield stress, the creep
deformation occurs only in the plastic range. If the threshold stress is
specified, an implicit integration scheme is used. Otherwise, an explicit
integration is used at the Gauss point level.

2. Several MFLUID entries corresponding to different fluid volumes can be

3. The wetted side of an element in ELIST1 is determined by the presence or
absence of a minus sign preceding the element’s ID on the ELIST entry. A
minus sign indicates that the fluid is on the side opposite to the element’s
positive normal, as determined by applying the right-hand rule to the
sequence of its corner points. The same element can appear on two ELIST
entries, indicating that it forms a barrier between the unconnected fluids.

X-Y PLOT

4. The fluid volume may be finite (interior) or infinite (exterior). The volume
may be bounded by a free surface and one or two planes of structural
symmetry. If structural symmetry is used, the structure must have the
symmetric or antisymmetric boundary corresponding to the selection in
fields 8 and 9. Interior fluids must have ELIST1 data and a free surface or
plane of antisymmetry.
5. The planes of symmetry and/or antisymmetry defined in fields 8 and 9 must
be planes of symmetry for the entire analysis. The user may apply
appropriate structural boundary conditions at all grid points lying in these
planes.

8. If there is ELIST1 data and no free surface nor plane of antisymmetry, the
program assumes a special form of external fluid. These special external
fluids must have a CID (field 3) such that the origin of the fluid coordinate
system is near the center of the enclosed volume, since the singularity for
volume change will be placed at the origin. Special external fluids are
supported only in SOLs 103 and 107 through 112. If used in conventional
solution sequences, System Fatal Message 3001 results for file 205.

11. A tolerance is computed for each wetted element, with the value of
0.01 ⋅ sqrt ( 2. ⋅ A ) , where A is the area of the element. If any grid point
connected to the element lies within TOL below the free surface it is moved
to the free surface.
12. Any element that has all grids on or above the free surface, after the grid
points are moved by the procedures given in Remark 11. is removed from the
ELIST. It is not included in the VM effects, and will produce no pressure
output.

is one that is used in the design model (in connection with either objective or
constraints) and, therefore, identified on a DRESP1 entry.
2. The range of modes LOWRNG through HIGHRNG, inclusive, will be used
to track the designed modes. If LOWRNG and HIGHRNG are both blank,
then all computed modes will be used to search for the designed modes.
Since large numbers of computed modes will result in higher computational
costs, limiting the search range with LOWRNG and HIGHRNG is
recommended.

orthogonalities are greater than MTFILTER.

Remarks:
1. The NLPARM entry is selected by the Case Control command
NLPARM = ID. Each solution subcase requires an NLPARM command.
2. In cases of static analysis (DT = 0.0) using Newton methods, NINC is the
number of equal subdivisions of the load change defined for the subcase.
Applied loads, gravity loads, temperature sets, enforced displacements, etc.,
define the new loading conditions. The differences from the previous case
are divided by NINC to define the incremental values. In cases of static
analysis (DT = 0.0) using arc-length methods, NINC is used to determine the
initial arc-length for the subcase, and the number of load subdivisions will
not be equal to NINC. In cases of creep analysis (DT > 0.0), NINC is the
number of time step increments.
3. The unit of DT must be consistent with the unit used on the CREEP entry that
defines the creep characteristics. Total creep time for the subcase is DT
multiplied by the value in the field NINC; i.e., DT*NINC.
4. The stiffness update strategy is selected in the KMETHOD field.

Parameters for Nonlinear Static Analysis Control

• If the AUTO option is selected, the program automatically selects the
most efficient strategy based on convergence rates. At each step the
number of iterations required to converge is estimated. Stiffness is
updated, if (i) estimated number of iterations to converge exceeds
MAXITER, (ii) estimated time required for convergence with current
stiffness exceeds the estimated time required for convergence with
updated stiffness, and (iii) solution diverges. See Remarks 9. and 13.
for diverging solutions.

1
nastran

2
FMS

• If the SEMI option is selected, the program for each load increment (i)
performs a single iteration based upon the new load, (ii) updates the
stiffness matrix, and (iii) resumes the normal AUTO option.

• If the ITER option is selected, the program updates the stiffness matrix
at every KSTEP iterations and on convergence if KSTEP < MAXITER.
However, if KSTEP > MAXITER, stiffness matrix is never updated.
Note that the Newton-Raphson iteration strategy is obtained by
selecting the ITER option and KSTEP = 1, while the Modified
Newton-Raphson iteration strategy is obtained by selecting the ITER
option and KSTEP = MAXITER.
5. For AUTO and SEMI options, the stiffness matrix is updated on convergence
if KSTEP is less than the number of iterations that were required for
convergence with the current stiffness.
6. The number of iterations for a load increment is limited to MAXITER. If the
solution does not converge in MAXITER iterations, the load increment is
bisected and the analysis is repeated. If the load increment cannot be
bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS = 0) and MAXDIV is positive,
the best attainable solution is computed and the analysis is continued to the
next load increment. If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis is terminated.
7. The test flags (U = displacement error, P = load equilibrium error, and
W = work error) and the tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and EPSW) define the
convergence criteria. All the requested criteria (combination of U, P, and/or
W) are satisfied upon convergence. See the MSC.Nastran Handbook for
Nonlinear Analysis for more details on convergence criteria.
8. INTOUT controls the output requests for displacements, element forces and
stresses, etc. YES or ALL must be specified in order to be able to perform a
subsequent restart from the middle of a subcase.

• For the Newton family of iteration methods (i.e., when no NLPCI
command is specified), the option ALL is equivalent to option YES
since the computed load increment is always equal to the
user-specified load increment.

• For arc-length methods (i.e., when the NLPCI command is specified)
the computed load increment in general is not going to be equal to the
user-specified load increment, and is not known in advance. The
option ALL allows the user to obtain solutions at the desired
intermediate load increments.
9. The ratio of energy errors before and after the iteration is defined as
divergence rate ( E i ) , i.e.,

Depending on the divergence rate, the number of diverging iteration (NDIV)
is incremented as follows:
i

If – 10

, then NDIV = NDIV + 2

i

< E < – 1 , then NDIV = NDIV + 1

The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV > |MAXDIV|. If the
solution diverges and the load increment cannot be further bisected (i.e.,
MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS is zero), the stiffness is updated based on the
previous iteration and the analysis is continued. If the solution diverges
again in the same load increment while MAXDIV is positive, the best
solution is computed and the analysis is continued to the next load
increment. If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis is terminated on the second
divergence.

10. The BFGS update is performed if MAXQN > 0. As many as MAXQN
quasi-Newton vectors can be accumulated. The BFGS update with these QN
vectors provides a secant modulus in the search direction. If MAXQN is
reached, no additional ON vectors will be accumulated. Accumulated QN
vectors are purged when the stiffness is updated and the accumulation is
resumed.
11. The line search is performed as required, if MAXLS > 0. In the line search,
the displacement increment is scaled to minimize the energy error. The line
search is not performed if the absolute value of the relative energy error is
less than the value specified in LSTOL.
12. The number of subincrements in the material routines (elastoplastic and
creep) is determined so that the subincrement size is approximately
FSTRESS ⋅ σ (equivalent stress). FSTRESS is also used to establish a tolerance
for error correction in the elastoplastic material; i.e.,
error in yield function < FSTRESS ⋅ σ
If the limit is exceeded at the converging state, the program will exit with a
fatal message. Otherwise, the stress state is adjusted to the current yield
surface.
13. The number of bisections for a load increment/arc-length is limited to the
absolute value of MAXBIS. Different actions are taken when the solution
diverges depending on the sign of MAXBIS. If MAXBIS is positive, the
stiffness is updated on the first divergence, and the load is bisected on the
second divergence. If MAXBIS is negative, the load is bisected every time the
solution diverges until the limit on bisection is reached. If the solution does
not converge after |MAXBIS| bisections, the analysis is continued or
terminated depending on the sign of MAXDIV. See Remark 9.
14. MAXR is used in the adaptive load increment/arc-length method to define
the overall upper and lower bounds on the load increment/arc-length in the
subcase; i.e.,
1 - ∆l
n
----------------≤ -------- ≤ MAXR
MAXR ∆l o
where ∆l n is the arc-length at step n and ∆l o is the original arc-length. The
arc-length method for load increments is selected by an NLPCI Bulk Data
entry. This entry must have the same ID as the NLPARM Bulk Data entry.

15. The bisection is activated if the incremental rotation for any degree-offreedom ( ∆θ x, ∆θ y, or ∆θz ) exceeds the value specified by RTOLB. This
bisection strategy is based on the incremental rotation and controlled by
MAXBIS.
16. Default tolerance sets are determined based on model type and desired
accuracy. Accuracy is under user control and can be specified on the
PARAM, NLTOL entry. NLTOL’s value is used only if the CONV, EPSU,
EPSP and EPSW fields are blank, and if NINC is set to a value of 10 or larger.

17. The method to compute the energy (work) error is different for SOL 106 and
SOL 400. for SOL 106, the energy error is computed based on the residue
forces. While, for SOL 400, the energy error computed is the total energy
error, which is based on the nonlinear forces acting on the structure. At the
start of the iteration, these two methods give approximately the same value.
However, near convergence, the SOL 106 method will field a much smaller
value than that provided by the SOL 400 method. The difference in these two
methods is reflected in the default values shown in Remark 16. The reason
for a new method used in SOL 400 is that it gives the true error of the physical
energy. On the other hand, the error computed in SOL 106 has no counter
part in the physical world.
18. For SOL 600, the only fields used are ID, NINC, DT (creep only), EPSU, EPSP,
and EPSW. Use PARAM,MARCOTIM instead of INTOUT. For other fields,
advanced convergence controls are available using NLAUTO, NLSTRAT
and PARAM,MARCDEF Bulk Data entries.

OUTPUT

X-Y PLOT

The constraint equation has a disparity in the dimension by mixing the
displacements with the load factor. The scaling factor ( w ) is introduced as
user input so that the user can make constraint equation unit-dependent by
a proper scaling of the load factor µ . As the value of w is increased, the
constraint equation is gradually dominated by the load term. In the limiting
case of infinite w , the arc-length method is degenerated to the conventional
Newton’s method.
3. The MINALR and MAXALR fields are used to limit the adjustment of the
arc-length from one load increment to the next by:
∆l new
MINALR ≤ --------------- ≤ MAXALR
∆l old
The arc-length adjustment is based on the convergence rate (i.e., number of
iterations required for convergence) and the change in stiffness. For constant
arc-length during analysis, use MINALR = MAXALR = 1.

4. The arc-length ∆l for the variable arc-length strategy is adjusted based on the
number of iterations that were required for convergence in the previous load
increment ( I max ) and the number of iterations desired for convergence in the
current load increment (DESITER) as follows:
∆l new =

DESITER ⋅ ∆l old
-------------------------------------------I max

5. The MXINC field is used to limit the number of controlled increment steps
in case the solution never reaches the specified load. This field is useful in
limiting the number of increments computed for a collapse analysis.

Remarks:

2. Multiple NLRGAP entries with the same SID are allowed.
3. The NLRGAP is not an element, but a nonlinear load similar to the NOLINi
Bulk Data entries. It computes the relative displacements of GA and GB in
the selected plane and applies appropriate nonlinear loads to simulate the
radial contact.
4. The degrees-of-freedom in the XY, YZ, or ZX planes (depending on the
PLANE) of GA and GB must be members of the solution set. This means the
e-set for modal formulation and the d-set for direct formulation. If RADIUS
is > 0.0, then the in-plane rotation degree-of-freedom must also be in the
solution set.

5. As with the NOLINi entries, the NLRGAP is limited to use in direct transient

6. The XY, YZ and ZX planes are relative to the displacement coordinates
systems of GA and GB. GA and GB should be coincident grids with parallel
displacement coordinate systems. MSC.Nastran does not check nor enforces
this. Wrong answers can occur if this rule is not followed.
7. The shaft radius is used only for the computation of friction induced torque.
8. In the underlying equations, a positive coefficient of friction is consistent
with counter-clockwise shaft rotation from axis 1 towards axis 2
(anti-clockwise). A negative coefficient of friction is consistent with
clockwise shaft rotation from axis 2 towards axis 1 (clockwise). See Figure 8109.

Output Options for p-elements

Remarks:
1. OUTRCV is intended for p-elements only and specifies the coordinate
system and density used for displacement, stress, strain, and force output.
OUTRCV is used only for output and has no effect on the solution.
2. On the continuation entries, no commas can appear in columns 1 through 8
and the data in fields 2 through 9 must be specified in columns 9 through 72.
3. Sets referenced by SETID are defined on the SET command after the SETS
DEFINITION or OUTPUT(POST) command. Any p-element not referenced
by the SET = SETID Case Control command will use the defaults listed above
for CID and VIEW.
4. If an element is referenced by more than one OUTRCV entry then a warning
message will be issued and the last OUTRCV will be applied to the element.
5. ξ*η*j represents the ξ , η and ζ subdivisions in the solid element’s output
recovery parametric system. Both “*” delimiters are required. η is ignored
for the CPENTA and CTETRA element and ξ is ignored for the CTETRA,
CQUAD4, and CTRIA3 element.
6. The elements referenced by the SET = SETID command are labeled in the
stress output as VUHEXA, VUPENTA, VUTETRA, VUQUAD, VUTRIA, and
VUBEAM. They may be renamed via the PARAM,VUHEXA;
PARAM,VUPENTA; PARAM,VUTETRA; PARAM,VUQUAD;
PARAM,VUTRIA; and PARAM,VUBEAM entries.
7. Only one OUTRCV Case Control command is allowed. Multiple OUTRCV
Bulk Data entries with the same SID are allowed to specify multiple element
sets with different output coordinate systems.

8. The displacement output at locations defined by the GRID Bulk Data entry
are determined by the CD value located on the GRID Bulk Data entry.
9. For p-version shell elements, the default output coordinates system is the
convective coordinate system tangent to the shell mid surface. The x-axis of
the convective system is the projected x-axis of the basic system. For
p-version beam elements, the output system is the convective coordinate
system tangent to the beam axis, oriented from grid A to grid B, as specified
on the CBEAM entry.

10. The PROJ and NORMAL options for shells are described in the following
list.
PROJ

Defines the orientation of the output coordinate system
for stresses, strains and forces in shell elements. The
reference system for PROJ is the CID coordinate system.

PROJ = F

Stresses, strains and forces of shells are output in the
fixed CID. This option should be used if a postprocessor
requires the results in terms of 3D vectors or tensors. For
example, stress tensors with 6 components. The option
does not produce output in the f06 file.

PROJ = X, Y, Z

The x- or y- or z-axis of the CID system is projected on to
the shell tangent plane, the projected vector defines the
x-axis of the convective coordinate system for output of
stresses, strains and forces.

NORMAL

Specifies the positive normal direction of the output
coordinate system for stresses, strains, and forces in
shell elements. The reference system for NORMAL is
the CID coordinate system.

NORMAL = R

The positive direction of the normal is the exiting arrow
of the position vector from the origin of the CID system
to the element center.

NORMAL = E

The positive direction of the normal is the z-axis of the
element coordinate system.

NORMAL = X

The positive direction of the outward normal is the
exiting arrow of the x-axis.

NORMAL = Y,Z

The value of ( Z 2R + Z 2I ) must be greater than machine epsilon--a machine
dependent constant in the neighborhood of 1.E-15. The scale factor S can be
used to ensure this constraint while retaining the same units.
5. The output for the element is specified by the STRESS Case Control
command and consists of the resistance, reactance, and absorption
coefficient. The absorption coefficient is defined as:

2. All PARAMARC entries found in the bulk data will be used to form parallel
domains and associated MSC.Marc input decks if an option to create
MSC.Marc input or execute MSC.Marc is found in the Executive Control or
Case Control. There should only be one PARAMARC first line entry in the
Bulk Data. If more than one is found, only the first is used.
3. Use of KIND=2-5 provides more control than does the automatic (KIND=1)
option.
4. Several MSC.Marc input data files are produced. If the MSC.Nastran input
file is named a.dat or a.bdf, and 3 parallel domains are specified (NPROC=3)
the following files are produced:
a.marc.dat
1a.marc.dat
2a.marc.dat
3a.marc.dat
The file (a.marc.dat) is a stub model which contains only the control portion
of the model. The other files (1a.marc.dat, 2a.marc.dat, 3a.marc.dat) contain
the MSC.Marc input data for each domain and along with a.marc.dat will be
executed in parallel. MSC.Nastran will automatically build the command
string to execute MSC.Marc with the requested number of processors. A
simple parallel run with the same number of processors should be
successfully completed before attempting large models.
5. Execution of each domain can be controlled by a MSC.Marc host file,
jid.marc.host. If that file is not present, it is assumed that all processors are
on the same computer, or that the system administrator has setup some
method of controlling where the parallel processes execute. More
information concerning host files is available in the MSC.Marc New Features
Version 2001 Manual or by contacting MSC support.
6. The continuation entries should be entered as many times as necessary to
completely define each parallel region for KIND=2-5.
7. If the KIND=1 (automatic parallel) is requested and if 3D contact is present
all contact regions must be identified using BCTABLE entries. All BCTABLE
entries found in the bulk data will be used to determine the domains. For the
case where every element may potentially contact every other element in the
model, it is presently not possible to define parallel regions, so the full model
will be executed.

5. For response spectra analysis on stress recovery coefficients, the CBEAM
element should be used because results for the CBAR element will not be
accurate.
6. The GROUP is associated with an FMS CONNECT statement that specifies
the evaluator. A reserved GROUP name is “MSCBML0". Users may create
their own cross-section types. Each of the types will require one or more
subroutines to convert DIMi information to geometric property information
contained on a PBAR entry and optimization information. See “Building
and Using the Sample Programs” on page 251 of the MSC.Nastran 2004
Installation and Operations Guide for a discussion on how to include a userdefined beam library.
7. A function of this entry is to derive an equivalent PBAR entry. Any sorted
echo request will also cause printout and/or punch of the derived PBAR.
8. For GROUP = “MSCBML0", the cross-sectional properties, shear flexibility
factors, and stress recovery points (C, D, E, and F) are computed using the
TYPE and DIMi as shown in Figure 8-112. The origin of element coordinate
system is centered at the shear center of the cross-section oriented as shown.
The PBARL does not account for offsets between the neutral axis and the
shear center. Therefore, the CHAN, CHAN1 and CHAN2 cross-sections may
produce incorrect results. The PBEAML is recommended.
9. For DBOX section, the default value for DIM5 to DIM10 are based on the
following rules:
a. DIM5, DIM6, DIM7 and DIM8 have a default value of DIM4 if not
provided.
b. DIM9 and DIM19 have a default value of DIM4 if not provided.
NOTE: The above default value rules for DIM5 to DIM10 are not
applicable to design optimization property value update.

by symmetry must not exceed 20. If these are not specified, the program

2. For structural problems, MID and MIDi must reference a MAT1 material
entry. For material nonlinear analysis, the material should be perfectly
plastic since the plastic hinge formulation is not valid for strain hardening.
For heat transfer problems, MID and MIDi must reference a MAT4 or MAT5
material entry.
3. For the case where the user specifies I1, I2 and I12 on the parent entry, the
stress-output location may also be specified on continuation entries. The
(y,z) coordinates specified on these entries will serve as stress output
locations with the corresponding Ci’s set to 0. Stress output is provided at the
first four lumped area locations only. If one of the symmetry options is used
and fewer than four lumped areas are input explicitly, the sequence of
output locations in the imaged quadrants is shown in Figure 8-113. For one
specific example in the model shown in Remark 7. (Figure 8-114), output can
be obtained at points 1 and 2 and in the image points 3 and 4.
4. Blank fields for K1 and K2 are defaulted to 1.0. If a value of 0.0 is used for K1
and K2, the transverse shear stiffness becomes rigid and the transverse shear
flexibilities are set to 0.0.
5. The values E 0 and G 0 are computed based on the value of MID on the parent
entry. MID is will follow the same symmetry rules as Ci depending on the
value of SECTION. If the MIDi field on a continuation entry is blank, the
value will be that of MID on the parent entry. MIDi values may be input on
continuations without the corresponding Yi, Zi, and Ci values to allow
different stress-strain laws.
6. If the lumped cross-sectional areas are specified, fields I1, I2, and I12 will be
ignored. These and other modified values will be calculated based on the
input data (Yi, Zi, Ci, MIDi) as follows:

7. As can be seen from Figure 8-113, if the user chooses to leave the SECTION
field blank, the program defaults to the elliptically distributed eight
nonlinear rods, similar to the PBEAM entry. For this particular case it is
illegal to supply Ci and MIDi values. For a doubly symmetric section
(SECTION = 1), if the lumped areas are specified on either axis, the
symmetry option will double the areas. For example, for the section shown
in Figure 8-114, points 2 and 4 are coincident and so are points 6 and 8. In
such cases, it is recommended that users input the value of area as half of the
actual value at point 2 to obtain the desired effect.

Beam Property

Remarks:
1. For structural analysis, MID must reference a MAT1 material entry. For
material nonlinear analysis, MID may also reference a MATS1 entry, but the
material properties must be defined as elastic-perfectly plastic; for example,
H = 0.0 on the MATS1 entry. Also, only one-eighth of the length at each end
of the element abides by material nonlinear law; i.e., the element is modeled
as a plastic hinge. Any other type of material property specification may
yield inaccurate results.

1
nastran

2
FMS

2. For heat transfer analysis, MID must reference a MAT4 or MAT5 material
entry.
3. If no stress data at end A is to be recovered and a continuation with the SO
field is specified, then the first continuation entry, which contains the fields
C1(A) through F2(A), may be omitted.
4. If SO is "YESA" or "NO", the third continuation entry, which contains the
fields C1 through F2, must be omitted. If SO is "YES", the continuation for Ci,
Di, Ei, and Fi must be the next entry. The blank fields are defaulted to 0.0 on
these continuations.
5. The rules for the continuations entries are:

• The second and third continuation entries, which contain fields SO
through F2, may be repeated nine more times for intermediate X/XB
values for linear beam elements. The order of these continuation pairs
is independent of the X/XB value; however, one value of X/XB must
be 1.0, corresponding to end B. The intermediate stress output
requests will be ignored in the nonlinear solution sequences
(SOLs 106 and 129).

CASE

OUTPUT

4C

PARAM

• The fourth and fifth continuation entries, which contain fields K1
through N2(B), are optional and may be omitted if the default values
are appropriate.
6. If any fields 4 through 9 are blank on the continuation with the value of
X/XB = 1.0, then the values for A, I1, I2, I12, J and NSM are set to the values
given for end A. For the continuations that have intermediate values of X/XB
between 0.0 and 1.0 and use the default option (any of the fields 4 through 9
are blank), a linear interpolation between the values at ends A and B is
performed to obtain the missing section properties.
7. Blank fields for K1, K2 are defaulted to 1.0. If a value of 0.0 is used for K1 and
K2, the transverse shear flexibilities are set to 0.0 and field G on the MAT1
entry selected by MID must be nonzero.

2. PID must be unique with respect to all other PBEAM and PBEAML property
identification numbers.
3. For heat-transfer problems, the MID must reference a MAT4 or MAT5
material entry.
4. See the PBEAM entry description for a discussion of beam-element
geometry.
5. If any of the fields NSM(B), DIMi(B) are blank on the continuation entry for
End B, the values are set to the values given for end A. For the continuation
entries that have values of X(j)/XB between 0.0 and 1.0 and use the default
option (blank field), a linear interpolation between the values at ends A and
B is performed to obtain the missing field.
6. The GROUP is associated with a FMS CONNECT statement, which specifies
the evaluator. A reserved GROUP name is “MSCBML0". Users may create
their own cross-section types. Each of the types will require a one or more
subroutines to convert DIMi information to geometric property information
contained on a PBEAM entry. See “Building and Using the Sample
Programs” on page 251 of the MSC.Nastran 2004 Installation and Operations
Guide for a discussion of how to include a user-defined beam library.
7. For GROUP = “MSCBML0", the cross-sectional properties, shear flexibility
factors and stress recovery points are computed using the TYPE and DIMi as
shown in Figure 8-116. The element coordinate system is located at the shear
center.
8. A function of this entry is to derive an equivalent PBEAM entry. Any sorted
echo request will also cause printout and/or punch of the derived PBEAM.

The flexibility factor is set to unity. The stress intensification
factor in plane 2 using the general or alternate format is set
to unity and for plane 1 it is set to the following:
I1

applies to Ti.
2. At least one of the four values (MIDi, Ti, THETAi, SOUTi) must be present
for a ply to exist. The minimum number of plies is one.
3. The TREF specified on the material entries referenced by plies are not used.
Instead TREF on the PCOMP entry is used for all plies of the element. If not
specified, it defaults to “0.0.”
If the PCOMP references temperature dependent material properties, then
the TREF given on the PCOMP will be used as the temperature to determine
material properties.
TEMPERATURE Case Control commands are ignored for deriving the
equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries used to describe the composite
element.
If for a nonlinear static analysis the parameter COMPMATT is set to YES, the
temperature at the current load step will be used to determine temperaturedependent material properties for the plies and the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2 entries for the composite element. The TREF on the PCOMP entry will
be used for the initial thermal strain on the composite element and the
stresses on the individual plies. If the parameter EPSILONT is also set to
INTEGRAL,TREF is not applicable.
4. GE given on the PCOMP entry will be used for the element and the values
supplied on material entries for individual plies are ignored. The user is

used.
8. A function of this entry is to derive equivalent internal PSHELL and MATi
entries to describe the composite element. Any sorted echo request will also
cause printout and/or punch of the derived PSHELL and MATi entries in
User Information Message 4379 and/or the punch file. (See “Additional
Topics” on page 529 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide, for proper
interpretation of the output from User Information Message 4379.) However,
if these equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries are input, then stress or strain
output for individual plies is not available and PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 must
be supplied.
Use the NASTRAN system cell (361) PRTPCOMP=1 to print equivalent
PSHELL/MAT2 Bulk Data entries to the .f06 file. Use the ECHO=PUNCH
Case Control command to write them to the .pch file.
9. The failure index for the boundary material is calculated as Failure Index =
( τ 1z, τ 2z ) ⁄ SB .
10. If the value specified for Z0 is not equal to -0.5 times the thickness of the
element and PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 is specified, then the homogeneous
element stresses are incorrect, while lamina stresses and element forces and
strains are correct. For correct homogeneous stresses, use ZOFFS on the
corresponding connection entry.
11. An unsymmetric layup or the use of Z0 to specify an unsymmetric layup, is
not recommended in buckling analysis or the calculation of differential
stiffness. Also, Z0 should not be used to specify an unsymmetric layup.
12. To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio
C ⁄ C 0 by 2.0.

Material ID of the various plies. The plies are identified by serially
numbering them from 1 at the bottom layer. The MIDs must refer to MAT1,
MAT2, or MAT8 Bulk Data entries. See Remarks 2. and 17. (Integer > 0 or
blank, except MID1 must be specified.)

Ti

Thicknesses of the various plies. See Remark 2. (Real or blank, except T1
must be specified.)

THETAi

Orientation angle of the longitudinal direction of each ply with the material
axis of the element. (If the material angle on the element connection entry is
0.0, the material axis and side 1-2 of the element coincide.) The plies are to
be numbered serially starting with 1 at the bottom layer. The bottom layer
is defined as the surface with the largest -Z value in the element coordinate
system. (Real; Default = 0.0)

Layered Composite Element Property (Alternate to PCOMP Entry)

Remarks:
1. The global ply identification number should be unique with respect to other
plies in the entry.
2. The default for MID2, ..., MIDn is the last defined MIDi. In the example
above, MID1 is the default for MID2, MID3, and MId4. The same logic
applies to Ti.
3. The global ply ID (GPLYIDi) and at least one of the four values (MIDi, Ti,
THETAi, SOUTi) must be present for a ply to exist. The minimum number of
plies is one.
4. The TREF specified on the material entries referenced by plies are not used.
Instead TREF on the PCOMPG entry is used for all plies of the element. If not
specified, it defaults to “0.0.”
If the PCOMPG references temperature dependent material properties, then
the TREF given on the PCOMPG will be used as the temperature to
determine material properties.
TEMPERATURE Case Control commands are ignored for deriving the
equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries used to describe the composite
element.
If for a nonlinear static analysis the parameter COMPMATT is set to YES, the
temperature at the current load step will be used to determine temperaturedependent material properties for the plies and the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2 entries for the composite element. The TREF on the PCOMPG entry
will be used for the initial thermal strain on the composite element and the
stresses on the individual plies. If the parameter EPSILONT is also set to
INTEGRAL,TREF is not applicable.
5. GE given on the PCOMPG entry will be used for the element and the values
supplied on material entries for individual plies are ignored. The user is
responsible for supplying the equivalent damping value on the PCOMPG
entry. If PARAM,W4 is not specified GE is ignored in transient analysis.
6. Stress and strain output for individual plies are available in all superelement
static and normal modes analysis and requested by the STRESS and STRAIN
Case Control commands.
7. If PARAM,NOCOMPS is set to -1, stress and strain output for individual
plies will be suppressed and the homogeneous stress and strain output will
be printed. See also Remark 11.

-2 - failure in the matrix direction

9. A function of this entry is to derive equivalent internal PSHELL and MATi
entries to describe the composite element. Any sorted echo request will also
cause printout and/or punch of the derived PSHELL and MATi entries in
User Information Message 4379 and/or the punch file. (See “Additional
Topics” on page 529 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide, for proper
interpretation of the output from User Information Message 4379.) However,
if these equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries are input, then stress or strain
output for individual plies is not available and PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 must
be supplied.
Use the NASTRAN system cell (361) PRTPCOMP=1 to print equivalent
PSHELL/MAT2 Bulk Data entries to the .f06 file. Use the ECHO=PUNCH
Case Control command to write them to the .pch file.
10. The failure index for the boundary material is calculated as Failure Index =
( τ 1z, τ 2z ) ⁄ SB .
11. If the value specified for Z0 is not equal to -0.5 times the thickness of the
element and PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 is specified, then the homogeneous
element stresses are incorrect, while lamina stresses and element forces and
strains are correct. For correct homogeneous stresses, use ZOFFS on the
corresponding connection entry.
12. An unsymmetric layup or the use of Z0 to specify an unsymmetric layup, is
not recommended in buckling analysis or the calculation of differential
stiffness. Also, Z0 should not be used to specify an unsymmetric layup.
13. To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio
C ⁄ C 0 by 2.0.
14. The SYM option for the LAM option computes the complete stiffness
properties while specifying half the plies. The MEM, BEND, SMEAR and
SMCORE options provide special purpose stiffness calculations. SMEAR
ignores stacking sequence and is intended for cases where this sequence is
not yet known, stiffness properties are smeared. SMCORE allows simplified
modeling of a sandwich panel with equal face sheets and a central core.

15. Element output for the SMEAR and SMCORE options is produced using the
PARAM NOCOMPS -1 methodology that suppresses ply stress/strain
results and prints results for the equivalent homogeneous element.

Optimization. May not be rerferenced on DVPRELi and DRESPi entries.

2. For most contact problems, KA (penalty value) should be chosen to be three
orders of magnitude higher than the stiffness of the neighboring grid points.
A much larger KA value may slow convergence or cause divergence, while
a much smaller KA value may result in inaccurate results. The value is
adjusted as necessary if TMAX > 0.0.

3. When the gap is open, there is no transverse stiffness. When the gap is closed
and there is friction, the gap has the elastic stiffness (KT) in the transverse
direction until the friction force is exceeded and slippage starts to occur.
4. There are two kinds of gap elements: adaptive gap and nonadaptive gap. If
TMAX > 0.0, the adaptive gap element is selected by the program. When
TMAX = 0.0, penalty values will not be adjusted, but other adaptive features
will be active (i.e., the gap-induced stiffness update, gap-induced bisection,
and subincremental process). The value of TMAX = -1.0 selects the
nonadaptive (old) gap element. The recommended allowable penetration
TMAX is about 10% of the element thickness for plates or the equivalent
thickness for other elements that are connected to the gap.
5. The maximum adjustment ratio MAR is used only for the adaptive gap
element. Upper and lower bounds of the adjusted penalty are defined by

of loading may vary over the surface of the element. The load intensity is the
load per unit of surface area, not the load per unit of area normal to the
direction of loading.

3. For the faces of solid elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted
continuation) is inward. For triangular and quadrilateral faces, the load
intensity P1 acts at grid point G1 and load intensities P2, P3, (and P4) act at
the other corners in a sequence determined by applying the right-hand rule
to the outward normal.
4. For plate elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted
continuation) is in the direction of positive normal, determined by applying
the right-hand rule to the sequence of connected grid points. The load
intensities P1, P2, P3, (and P4) act respectively at corner points G1, G2, G3,
(and G4) for triangular and quadrilateral elements. (See plate connection
entries.)
5. If P2, P3, and P4 are blank fields, the load intensity is uniform and equal to
P1. P4 has no meaning for a triangular face and may be left blank in this case.
6. Equivalent grid point loads are computed by linear or bilinear interpolation
of load intensity followed by numerical integration using isoparametric
shape functions. Note that a uniform load intensity will not necessarily result
in equal equivalent grid point loads.
7. G1 and G3 are ignored for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8,
and CQUADR elements.
8. The alternate format is available only for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR,
CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and CQUADR elements. The continuation entry may
be used in the alternate format.
9. For triangular faces of CPENTA elements, G1 is an identification number of
a corner grid point that is on the face being loaded and the G3 or G4 field is
left blank. For faces of CTETRA elements, G1 is an identification number of
a corner grid point that is on the face being loaded and G4 is an identification
number of the corner grid point that is not on the face being loaded. Since a
CTETRA has only four corner points, this point G4 will be unique and
different for each of the four faces of a CTETRA element.
10. For the CQUADR and CTRIAR element, only pressure that acts normal to
the element is computed properly. Surface tractions are not resolved into
moments normal to the element.
11. All referenced elements must exist (closed list) for residual only runs and are
not required to exist (open list) for superelement runs; and they cannot be
hyperelastic for either.

PLOAD4

1877

Pressure Load on Surface and Faces of Solid Elements

12. If fields 3 through 5 of the continuation entry are not blank, the load is
assumed to have a fixed direction. If fields 2 through 5 of the continuation
entry are left blank, the load is assumed to be a pressure load. In this case,
follower force effects are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are
SOLs 103, 105, 107 to 112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter “FOLLOWK”
on page 649). In addition, follower force effects are included in the force
balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear transient dynamic solution
sequences, SOLs 106, 129, 153, and 159, if geometric nonlinear effects are
turned on with PARAM,LGDISP,1. The follower force stiffness is included in
the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106 and 153) but not in the
nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 129 and 159).
13. The SORL field is ignored by all elements except QUADR and TRIAR. For
QUADR or TRIAR only, if SORL=LINE, the consistent edge loads are
defined by the PLOAD4 entry. P1, P2, P3 and P4 are load per unit length at
the corner of the element. If all four Ps are given, then the line loads along all
four edges of the element are defined. If any P is blank, then the line loads for
only two edges are defined. For example, if P1 is blank, the line loads of the
two edges connecting to G1 are zero. If two Ps are given, then the line load
of the edge connecting to the two grid points is defined. If only one P is given,
the second P value default to the first P value. For example, P1 denotes that
the line load along edge G1 and G2 has the constant value of P1.
14. The direction of the line load (SORL=LINE) is defined by either (CID, N1,
N2, N3) or LDIR. Fatal error will be issued if both methods are given. TANG
denotes that the line load is in tangential direction of the edge, pointing from
G1 to G2 if the edge is connecting G1 and G2. NORM denotes that the line
load is in the mean plan, normal to the edge, and pointing outward from the
element. X, Y, or Z denotes the line load is in the X, Y, or Z direction of the
element coordinate system. If both (CID, N1, n2, N3) and LDIR are blank,
then the default is LDIR=NORM.

Remarks:
1. All PSHEAR entries should have unique identification numbers with respect
to all other property entries.
2. The effective extensional area is defined by means of equivalent rods on the
perimeter of the element. If F1 < 1.01, the areas of the rods on edges 1-2 and
3-4 are set equal to ( F1 ⋅ T ⋅ PA ) ⁄ ( L12 + L34 ) where PA is the panel
surface area-half the vector cross product area of the diagonals-and L12, L34
are the lengths of sides 1-2 and 3-4. Thus, if F1 = 1.0, the panel is fully
effective for extension in the 1-2 direction. If F1 > 1.01, the areas of the rods
on edges 1-2 and 3-4 are each set equal to 0.5 ⋅ F1 ⋅ T2 .

the structural damping K 4 matrix is computed using the GE entries on the

Shell Element Property

• The MID4 field should be left blank if the material properties are

nastran

2
FMS

symmetric with respect to the middle surface of the shell. If the
element centerline is offset from the plane of the grid points but the
material properties are symmetric, the preferred method for
modeling the offset is by use of the ZOFFS field on the connection
entry. Although the MID4 field may be used for this purpose, it may
produce ill-conditioned stiffness matrices (negative terms on factor
diagonal) if done incorrectly.

• Only one of the options MID4 or ZOFFS should be used; if both

methods are specified the effects are cumulative. Since this is
probably not what the user intented, unexpected answers will result.
Note that the mass properties are not modified to reflect the existence
of the offset when the ZOFFS and MID4 methods are used. If the
weight or mass properties of an offset plate are to be used in an
analysis, the RBAR method must be used to represent the offset. See
“Shell Elements (CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8,
CQUADR)” on page 131 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide.

• The effects of MID4 are not considered in the calculation of
differential stiffness. Therefore, it is recommended that MID4 be left
blank in buckling analysis.
7. This entry is referenced by the CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4,
CQUAD8, and CQUADR entries via PID.
8. For structural problems, MIDi must reference a MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8
material property entry
9. If the transverse shear material MID3 or the membrane-bending coupling
term MID4 references a MAT2 entry, then G33 must be zero. If MID3
references a MAT8 entry, then G1Z and G2Z must not be zero.
10. For heat transfer problems, MIDi must reference a MAT4 or MAT5 material
property entry.
11. The default for Z1 is -T/2, and for Z2 is +T/2. T is the local plate thickness
defined either by T on this entry or by membrane thicknesses at connected
grid points, if they are input on connection entries.
12. For plane strain analysis, set MID2=-1 and set MID1 to reference a MAT1
entry. In-plane loads applied to plain strain elements are interpreted as lineloads with a value equal to the load divided by the thickness. Thus, if a
thickness of “1.0” is used, the value of the line-load equals the load value.
Pressure can be approximated with multiple line loads where the pressure
value equals the line-load divided by the length between the loads.

PSHELL

1899

Shell Element Property

13. For the CQUADR and CTRIAR elements, the MID4 field should be left blank
because their formulation does not include membrane-bending coupling.
14. If MIDi is greater than or equal to 108 , then parameter NOCOMPS is set to
+1 indicating that composite stress data recovery is desired. (MIDi greater
than 108 are generated by PCOMP entries.)
15. For a material nonlinear property, MID1 must reference a MATS1 entry and
be the same as MID2, unless a plane strain (MID2 = -1) formulation is
desired. Also, MID3 cannot reference a MATS1 entry.
16. If transverse shear flexibility is specified for a model with curved shells
where the loading is dominated by twist, results will not converge and may
be inaccurate. PARAM,SNORM should be set for this unique model
condition.

3. See the CHEXA, CPENTA, or CTETRA entry for the definition of the element
coordinate system. The material coordinate system (CORDM) may be the
basic system (0 or blank), any defined system (Integer > 0), or the element
coordinate system (-1). The default value for CORDM is zero unless it is
overridden by the NASTRAN statement with the CORDM keyword. See
“nastran Command and NASTRAN Statement” on page 1.
4. If MID references a MAT9 entry, then CORDM defines the material property
coordinate system for Gij on the MAT9 entry. CORDM is ignored in the
stress output labeled “NONLINEAR STRESSES” where only the element
coordinate system is used.
5. For CHEXA and CPENTA elements with no midside nodes, reduced shear
integration with bubble functions (ISOP = blank or “REDUCED” and
IN = blank or “BUBBLE”) is the default. This is recommended because it
minimizes shear locking and Poisson’s ratio locking and does not cause
modes of deformation that lead to no strain energy. The effects of using
nondefault values are as follows:
a. IN = “THREE” or 3 produces an overly stiff element.
b. If IN = “TWO” or 2 and the element has midside nodes, modes of
deformation may occur that lead to no strain energy.
c. Standard isoparametric integration (ISOP = “FULL” or 1 and
IN = “TWO” or 2; or “THREE” or 3) produces an element overly stiff in
shear. This type of integration is more suited to nonstructural problems.
6. IN = “BUBBLE” is not allowed for CTETRA elements or for CHEXA and
CPENTA elements with midside nodes.
7. If you use IN=”BUBBLE” for CTETRA elements, NASTRAN internally
switch to IN=2 if you have 4-noded CTETRA element and IN=3 greater than
4 nodes.
8. Stress output may be requested at the Gauss points (STRESS = “GAUSS” or
1) of CHEXA and CPENTA elements with no midside nodes. Gauss point
output is available for the CTETRA element with or without midside nodes.
9. The following tables indicate the allowed options and combination of
options. If a combination not found in the table is used, then a warning
message will be issued and default values will be assigned for all options.
10. The gauss point locations for the solid elements are documented in “” on
page 568 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Manual.

1. CID facilitates the specification of the p-order in curvilinear systems. For
example, when modeling a thin cylinder, the user can restrict the p-order
through the thickness of all elements to be 2 or 3 without specifically
checking the connectivity of each element.
2. If the CID system is blank, the element’s topology is used to establish the 1,
2, 3 directions. The 1 direction is from the first to the second grid of the
element, the 2 direction is from the first to the fourth, and, the 3 direction is
from the first to the fifth. If CID is not blank then the following algorithm will

PVAL

be used to determine the p-order of each edge: a vector will be defined in the
CID system from the first to the second grid of every edge. (Curvilinear
systems are evaluated at the mid point of this vector). The p-level of each
edge is now determined by the nearest integer to:
p =

where ( n 1, n 2, n3 ) are the components of this unit vector in the CID system.

2
FMS

3. For accuracy and efficiency the recommended minimum p-order is 3. The
default value for POLY2 and POLY3 is POLY1.
4. Each finite element has to have a unique PVAL for PSTRTID, PMINID,
PMAXID. Any overlap of the PVAL specification will result in a warning
message and the use of the PVAL with the highest p i entry.
5. The intermediate PVAL entries generated will have an identification number
starting with ADGEN.
6. Whenever SETTYP = “SET”, a SET command must be defined under the
SETS DEFINITION command in the Case Control Section.
7. SET = 999999 is a reserved set that includes all elements.

Remarks:
1. The material MID, the diameter D, and the length are used to calculate the
stiffness of the connector in 6 directions. MID can only refer to the MAT1
Bulk Data entry. The length is the distance of GA to GB (see Figure 8-131).
2. The parameter MSET is active only for the formats ELEMID and GRIDID
(see “CWELD” on page 1204 for the format descriptions). MSET=”OFF”
incorporates constraints at the element stiffness matrix level avoiding
explicit m-set constraint equations. For the formats PARTPAT and ELPAT,
constraints are always eliminated on the element level. MSET=”ON”
generates explicit m-set constraints. For example, if a patch-to-patch
connection is specified with the formats “GRIDID” or “ELEMID” on the
CWELD entry, and MSET=ON is specified, 2x6 explicit constraints are
generated that connect the 6 degrees-of-freedom of GA to the translational
degrees-of-freedom of grid points GAi and the 6 degrees-of-freedom of GB
to GBi. The 2x6 degrees-of-freedom of GA and GB are put into the m-set. The
constraints are labeled “RWELD”. The identification numbers of the
generated RWELD constraint elements start with an offset of 100,001,001 by
default. The offset number can be changed with PARAM, OSWELM. For
MSET=”OFF” or blank, the 2x6 constraint equations are built into the
stiffness matrix of the CWELD element, thereby condensating the 2x6
degrees-of-freedom of GA and GB.

3. If TYPE=”SPOT” and if the formats PARTPAT, ELPAT, or ELEMID on the
CWELD entry are used, then the effective length for the stiffness of the
CWELD element is set to L e = 1 ⁄ 2 ⋅ ( tA + t B ) regardless of the distance GA to
GB. t A and tB are the shell thicknesses of shell A and B, respectively. The
effective length is used to avoid excessively stiff or soft connections due to
mesh irregularities.
4. If TYPE=blank, the effective length L e of the CWELD is equal to the true
length L, the distance of GA to GB, as long as the ratio of the length L to
diameter D is in the range LDMIN < L/D < LDMAX. If L is below the range,
the effective length is set to L e = LDMIN ⋅ D and if L is above the range, the
effective length is set to L e = LDMAX ⋅ D .

1. EIDi has material properties (MAT4) that include HGEN, the element
material property for heat generation, which may be temperature
dependent. This association is made through the element EID. If HGEN is
temperature dependent, it is based on the average element temperature.
2. QVOL provides either the constant volumetric heat generation rate or the
load multiplier. QVOL is positive for heat generation. For steady-state
analysis, the total power into an element is

• If CNTRLND = 0, then P in = volume ⋅ HGEN ⋅ QVOL .
• If CNTRLND > 0, then P in = volume ⋅ HGEN ⋅ QVOL ⋅ u CNTRLND .
where u CNTRLND is the temperature multiplier.
3. For use in steady-state analysis, the load set is selected in the Case Control
Section (LOAD = SID).

Volume Heat Addition

4. In transient analysis SID is referenced by a TLOADi Bulk Data entry. A
function of time F [ t – τ ] defined on the TLOADi entry multiplies the
general load where τ specifies time delay. The load set identifier on the
TLOADi entry must be selected in Case Control (DLOAD = SID) for use in
transient analysis. If multiple types of transient loads exist, they must be
combined by the DLOAD Bulk Data entry.
5. For “THRU” or “BY”, all intermediate referenced heat conduction elements

1. For the surfaces of an incomplete enclosure (view factors add up to less than
1.0), a complete enclosure may be achieved (SUM = 1.0) by specifying an
ambient element, ELEAMB. When multiple cavities are defined, each cavity
must have a unique ambient element if ambient elements are desired. No
elements can be shared between cavities.
2. Third-body shadowing is ignored in the cavity if SHADOW = “NO”. In
particular, if it is known a priori that there is no third-body shadowing,
SHADOW = NO overrides KSHD and KBSHD fields on the VIEW Bulk Data
entry as well as reduces the calculation time immensely.
3. The view factors for a complete enclosure may add up to slightly more than
1.0 due to calculation inaccuracies. SCALE can be used to adjust all the view
factors proportionately to acquire a summation equal to the value specified
for SCALE. If SCALE is left blank or set to 0.0, no scaling is performed.
4. If the VIEW3D Bulk Data entry is not specified, the view factors are
calculated using finite difference and contour integration methods. If
NFECI = “FD”, then all view factors are calculated using the finite difference
technique. NFECI = “CONT” invokes contour integration for all view factor
calculations. If NFECI is blank, the program selects a method to use between
any two particular elements based on RMAX.
5. The comparison value for RMAX is equal to A s ⁄ d 2rs where A s is the area of a
subelement and d rs is the distance between two subelements r and s for
which view factors are being computed. When NFECI is blank, the program
selects the contour integral method only if A s ⁄ d 2rs > RMAX .

RADCAV

6. When a number of elements are grouped together and considered as a
conglomerate surface, view factors can be calculated between these groups.
These are referred to as global view factors. The SET1 Bulk Data entry is
used to define the conglomerate. When using this feature, negative EIDs are
not allowed.

7. If a RADLST and RADMTX entry exists for this cavity ID, new view factors
are not computed and the existing RADLST and RADMTX are used in the

2. A radiation exchange matrix (RADMTX) can only reference one radiative
face list (RADLST). The companion RADCAV, RADLST, and RADMTX
must share a unique ICAVITY.
3. For each EIDi, the appropriate CHBDYi element is located, and the proper

3. For the linear method, the total number of components in CNA and CNB
must equal six; for example, CNA = 1236, CNB = 34. Furthermore, they must
jointly be capable of representing any general rigid body motion of the
element. For the Lagrange method, the total number of components must
also be six. However, only CNA = 123456 or CNB = 123456 is allowed. If both
CNA and CNB are blank, then CNA = 123456. For this method, RBAR1 gives
the simpler input format.
4. If both CMA and CMB are zero or blank, all of the degrees-of-freedom not in
CNA and CNB will be made dependent. For the linear method, the
dependent degrees-of-freedom will be made members of the m-set. For the
Lagrange method, they may or may not be member of the m-set, depending
on the method selected in the RIGID Case Control command. However, the
rules regarding the m-set described below apply to both methods.
5. The m-set coordinates specified on this entry may not be specified on other
entries that define mutually exclusive sets. See “Degree-of-Freedom Sets”
on page 845 for a list of these entries.
6. Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other
element identification numbers.
7. Rigid elements, unlike MPCs, are not selected through the Case Control
Command, MPC.
8. Forces of multipoint constraint may be recovered in all solution sequences,
except SOL 129, with the MPCFORCE Case Control command.
9. Rigid elements are ignored in heat transfer problems.
10. See “Rigid Elements and Multipoint Constraints (R-type, MPC)” on
page 167 of the MSC.Nastran Reference Guide for a discussion of rigid
elements.
11. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed for
the rigid bar element if user supplies the thermal expansion coefficient
ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control
commands. The temperature of the element is taken as the average
temperature of the two connected grid points GA and GB.

3. RBAR1 is a preferred input format to define the Lagrange method for a rigid

4. When CB = “123456” or blank, the grid point GB is constrained to move with
GA as a rigid bar. For default CB = “123456”. Any number of degrees-offreedom at grid point GB can be released not to move with the rigid body.

Remarks:
1. RESTART is available only when MSC.Marc is executed from within
MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600).
2. There should only be one RESTART entry in the bulk data. If more than one
exists, the first one will be used.
3. The KMATRIX option must be the same on all runs.
4. (i,j) Indicate the field in MSC.Marc’s RESTART model definition options. [i,j]
Indicate the field in MSC.Marc’s REAUTO model definition options.
5. Files with extensions .t08 and .t16 must be saved from the first run when a
restart run is executed. Both original and restart runs must be located in the
same directory.
6. A restart run may not have the same input file name (jid) as that of the
original run. In other words, if the input file for the original run is named
abcd.dat, the input file for a restart run may not be named abcd.dat.
7. For static analyses, normally each load case has a total time of 1.0. The first
case goes from 0.0 to 1.0, the second from 1.0 to 2.0, etc. If the first run has
two static load cases and terminates at 1.6, it is in the middle of the second
load case. The original run should be examined to determine which
increment (before 1.6) to begin the restart run.

7. In cyclic symmetry analyses, the T3 axis of the basic coordinate system must
be coincident with the axis of symmetry. In the DIH type of cyclic symmetry,
the T1 axis also must be parallel to side 1 of segment 1R of the model.
8. For superelement analysis, G should reference a residual structure point that
is exterior to all superelements. If it is not exterior to a superelement, then
centrifugal loads will not be generated for that superelement. However, in
cyclic analysis, User Fatal Message 4347 will be issued.
9. In a geometric nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106 when PARAM LDGISP is
set to +1), this type of loading is a follower force type of loading. However,
the orientation of coordinate system CID is not updated.
10. In nonlinear static solutions when there is more than one increment (INC)
specified on the NLPARM entry for a given subcase, the load vector resulting
from the RFORCE input (and not the angular velocity vector) is scaled
linearly. This means that loading by increments in the angular velocity can
only be achieved by having subcases where the RFORCE loading is applied
in a single increment.
11. The continuation entry is optional.
12. Forces due to angular acceleration (RACC) are computed with METHOD = 2
even if METHOD = 1 is specified.
13. Loads derived from this entry do not include effects due to mass specified
for scalar points.

RFORCE

1969

Rotational Force

14. The follower force effects due to loads from this entry are included in the
stiffness in all linear solution sequences that calculate a differential stiffness.
The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to 112, 115 and 116 (see also
the parameter “FOLLOWK” in Chapter 5). In addition, follower force effects
are included in the force balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear
transient dynamic solution sequences, SOLs 106, 129, 153, and 159, if
geometric nonlinear effects are turned on with PARAM,LGDISP,1. The
follower force stiffness is included in the nonlinear static solution sequences
(SOLs 106 and 153) but not in the nonlinear transient dynamic solution
sequences (SOLs 129 and 159).
15. The coordinate systems in the main Bulk Data Section are defined relative to
the assembly basic coordinate system which is fixed. This feature is useful
when a superelement defined by a partitioned Bulk Data Section is rotated
or mirrored and the gravity load is more conveniently defined in terms of
coordinates which are fixed.
16. If CID is not a rectangular coordinate system, RFORCE will treat it as if it
were and unexpected answers may result.
17. Follower force stiffness (param,followk,yes) is supported for method 2 only.

3. The length between grid points GA and GB must be zero.
4. When CB = “123456” or blank, the grid point GB is constrained to move with
GA and the two grid points moves as a single point. For default CB =
“123456”.
5. If any degree-of-freedom is released on CB, RJOINT becomes a mechanical
joint element. For example, CB = “12345”, then RJOINT becomes a hinge. CB
= “1234”, then RJOINT becomes a universal joint. And CB = “123”, RJOINT
becomes a spherical joint.

not controlled with the Case Control command RIGID.
2. A blank field for Ci indicates that all six degrees-of-freedom at Gi are
independent. Since G1 must be independent, no field is provided for C1.
Since the last grid point must also be independent, the last field must be a Gi,
not a Ci. For the example shown G1, G3, and G6 are independent. G2 has
six constrained degrees-of-freedom while G4 and G5 each have three.
3. Dependent (i.e., constrained) degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid
element may not also be assigned dependent by another rigid element or by
a multipoint constraint.

1. RSSCON generates a multipoint constraint that models a clamped
connection between a shell and a solid element. The shell degrees-offreedom are put in the dependent set (m-set). The translational degrees-offreedom of the shell edge are connected to the translational degrees-offreedom of the upper and lower solid edge. The two rotational degrees-offreedom of the shell are connected to the translational degrees-of-freedom of
the lower and upper edges of the solid element face. Poisson’s ratio effects
are considered in the translational degrees-of-freedom.
2. The shell grid point must lie on the line connecting the two solid grid points.
It can have an offset from this line, which can not be more than 5% of the
distance between the two solid grid points. The shell grid points that are out
of the tolerance will not be constrained, and a fatal message will be issued.
This tolerance is adjustable. Please see PARAM,TOLRSC and
PARAM,SEPIXOVR.
3. When using the TYPE = “ELEM” option

• The elements may be p-elements or h-elements. The solid elements
are CHEXA, CPENTA, and CTETRA with and without midside
nodes. The shell elements are CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUADR,
CTRIAR, CQUAD8, or CTRIA6.

• In case of p-elements, the p-value of the shell element edge is adjusted
to the higher of the p-value of the upper or lower solid p-element
edge. If one of the elements is an h-element, then the p-value of the
adjacent edge is lowered to 1.

• Both the shell and solid elements have to belong to the same
superelement. This restriction can be bypassed using SEELT entry to
reassign the downstream boundary element to an upstream
superelement.

• When a straight shell p-element edge and a solid p-element are
connected, the geometry of the shell edge is not changed to fit the
solid face. When a curved shell p-element edge and a solid p-element
are connected, the two solid edges and solid face are not changed to
match the shell edge.

• It is not recommended to connect more than one shell element to the

8

3. For the linear method, the total number of components in CNA, CNB, and
CNC must equal six; for example, CNA = 1236, CNB = 3, CNC = 3.
Furthermore, they must jointly be capable of representing any general rigid
body motion of the element. For the Lagrange method, the total number of
components must also be six. However, only CNA= 123456 or CNB = 123456
or CNC = 123456 is allowed. For this type of element, RTRPLT1 gives a
simpler input format.
4. For the linear method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom will be made
members of the m-set. For the Lagrange method, they may or may not be
members of the m-set, depending on the method selected on the RIGID Case
Control command. However, the rules regarding the m-set described below
apply to both types of methods.
5. Dependent degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid element may not also

downstream superelements must be prescribed by user action using other
entries. If they are scalar points, they are automatically in the residual
structure, which is the recommended procedure. If they are grid points, it is
the user’s responsibility to place them in a downstream superelement.
Generalized degrees-of-freedom of superelements that are also members of
the residual structure are included as dynamic variables by placing them in
the a-set. It is also necessary to place some or all residual structure physical
degrees-of-freedom in the a-set to allow the boundary points to participate
in the system mode shapes.
Grid points of downstream superelements used as generalized degrees-offreedom may be used for advanced applications, such as omitting upstream
generalized degrees-of-freedom from assembly into downstream
superelements. Again, it is the user’s responsibility to place these variables
in the proper set in all downstream superelements of which they are
members.

the user’s responsibility to place them in a downstream superelement.
Generalized degrees-of-freedom of superelements that are also members of
the residual structure are included as dynamic variables by placing them in
the a-set. It is also necessary to place some or all residual structure physical
degrees-of-freedom in the a-set, to allow the boundary points to participate
in the system mode shapes.
Grid points of downstream superelements used as generalized degrees-offreedom may be used for advanced applications, such as omitting upstream
generalized degrees-of-freedom from assembly into downstream
superelements. Again, it is the user’s responsibility to place these variables
in the proper set in all downstream superelements of which they are
members.
6. This entry may be applied only to primary superelements. The CSUPER
entry automatically defines these entries for secondary superelements.

2. In dynamic analysis, the selection of SID is determined by the presence of the
LOADSET request in Case Control as follows:

• There is no LOADSET request in Case Control
SID is selected by the EXCITEID ID of an RLOAD1, RLOAD2,
TLOAD1 or TLOAD2 Bulk Data entry that has enforced motion
specified in its TYPE field

• There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
SID is selected by LID in the selected LSEQ entries that correspond to
the EXCITEID entry of an RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1 or TLOAD2
Bulk Data entry that has enforced motion specified in its TYPE field.

will be applied. Intermediate values will provide smoothing.
4. When using the Mach Box method, BOX1 and BOX2 refer to the ID number
of the first and last aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry)
which will be used for interpolation to structural grids. BOX1 and BOX2 do
not refer to Mach Boxes.

defined in this entry is to be used for just the force transformation (FORCE)
or just the displacement transformation (DISP) or for both (BOTH).

ALL splines are of type BOTH is the familiar transpose relationship
T
[ GPgk ] = [ GDkg ] satisfied. The default behavior (BOTH for all splines)
is compatible with version of MSC.Nastran prior to Version 70.5.
In general, the USAGE field can be used to apply aerodynamic forces to the

important by including them in either FORCE or BOTH spline(s).
MSC.Nastran will NOT issue a warning unless ALL forces are omitted. All

Remarks:
1. The interpolated points (k-set) will be defined by aero boxes.
2. The spline axis for panels is the projection of the y-axis of coordinate system
CID, projected onto the plane of the panel. For bodies, the spline axis is
parallel to the x-axis of the aerodynamic coordinate system.
3. The flexibilities DZ, DTHX, and DTHY are used for smoothing. (Zero
attachment flexibility values will imply rigid attachment (i.e., no smoothing,
whereas negative values of DTHX or DTHY will imply infinity, therefore, no
attachment). See the MSC.Nastran Aeroelastic Analysis User’s Guide for a
discussion of special cases.
4. The continuation entry is required.
5. The SPLINE2 EID must be unique with respect to all SPLINEi entries.
6. When using the Mach Box method, ID1 and ID2 refer to the ID number of the
first and last aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry) which will
be used for interpolation to the structural grids. ID1 and ID2 do not refer to
Mach Boxes.
7. DTOR is the ratio of rotational to linear deflection and, in lieu of a more
accurate estimate, a value of 1.0 is recommended. A different value may be
used; e.g., if DTOR is much greater than 1.0, primarily rotational deflection
will occur; if DTOR is much less than 1.0, primarily linear deflection will
occur.
8. If a SPLINE2 element only references one grid point, the job will fail without
a message in the GI Module.

interpolation. If DZ = 0.0, the spline will pass through all deflected grid
points. If DZ is much greater than the spline area, a least squares plane fit
will be applied. Intermediate values will provide smoothing.
3. When using the Mach Box method, the AELIST boxes refer to the ID number
of the first and last aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry)
which will be used for interpolation to structural grids. They do not refer to
Mach Boxes.
4. The USAGE field allows you to specify that the particular spline interpolant
defined in this entry is to be used for just the force transformation (FORCE)
or just the displacement transformation (DISP) or for both (BOTH).
T

Fg = [ GPkg ] { Pk }

(FORCE/BOTH splines are in the transform)

Uk = [ GDkg ] { Ug }

(DISP/BOTH splines are in the transform)

In general, the two transforms are done with distinct matrices. Only when
ALL splines are of type BOTH is the familiar transpose relationship
T
[ GPgk ] = [ GDkg ] satisfied. The default behavior (BOTH for all splines) is
compatible with version of MSC.Nastran prior to Version 70.5.
In general, the USAGE field can be used to apply aerodynamic forces to the
structure from aerodynamic panels that are intended NOT to move
(USAGE=FORCE) or to apply structural displacements to aerodynamic
grids whose forces are not to be applied to the structure (USAGE=DISP). The
DISP option is somewhat esoteric in that you are then suggesting that the
aeroelastic effect of the surface is important while its forces are not. (In other
words, only the forces arising from tis effects on other surfaces is important.)
While there may be circumstances where this is true, it is unlikely. Take care
that you included all the FORCEs from aerodynamic panels that are
important by including them in either FORCE or BOTH spline(s).
MSC.Nastran will NOT issue a warning unless ALL forces are omitted. All
displacements may be omitted without warning (and is a means to perform
"rigid aerodynamic" analyses).

Remarks:

FMS

1. The interpolated points (k-set) will be defined by aero boxes.
2. The spline axis for panels is the projection of the y-axis of coordinate system
CID, projected onto the plane of the panel. For bodies, the interpolating beam
(y-axis) is parallel to the x-axis of the aerodynamic coordinate system; the zaxis is taken from the referenced CID and x is made orthogonal.
3. The flexibilities DZ, DTHX and DTHY are used for smoothing. (Zero
attachment flexibility values will imply rigid attachment (i.e., no smoothing,
whereas negative values of DTHX or DTHY will imply infinity, therefore, no
attachment.) See the MSC.Nastran Aeroelastic Analysis User’s Guide for a
discussion of special cases.
4. The continuation entry is required.
5. The SPLINE5 EID must be unique with respect to all SPLINEi entries.
6. When using the Mach Box method, the AELIST entries refer to the ID
numbers of aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry) which will
be used for interpolation to the structural grids. They do not refer to Mach
Boxes.
7. DTOR is the ratio of axial rotational to bending deflection and, in lieu of a
more accurate estimate, a value of 1.0 is recommended. A different value
may be used; e.g., if DTOR is much greater than 1.0, primarily rotational
deflection will occur; if DTOR is much less than 1.0, primarily linear
deflection will occur. The values will affect the results only if the structural
grids overconstrain the motion of the interpolating beam. Slender bodies
have no torsional motion, so these values will not be used for CAERO2
entries.
8. The USAGE field allows you to specify that the particular spline interpolant

3. The user defined grid point GS is projected on shell A and B to create the
connector end points GA and GB, respectively (see Figure 8-139). If GS lies
in between the shells A and B, the grids GA and GB are created through a
normal projection of GS on shell A and B, respectively. If GS lies outside of
the shells A and B, the grids GA’ and GB’ are created through a normal
projection of GS on shell A and B, respectively. Next, the point GC’ is created
in the middle between GA’ and GB’, A second normal projection of GC’ on
shells A and B gives the final points GA and GB. Then GA and GB are
connected to the shell grids GAi and GBi, respectively.

4. For the formats PARTPAT and ELPAT, starting with the axis GA,GB, four
pairs of auxiliary points GAHi, GBHi, i=1,2,3,4 must be found on shell A and
B, respectively (see Figure 8-140). The auxiliary points form a hexahedral of
length L and cross sectional area equivalent to a circle of diameter D (see
Figure 8-141). Two subsequent sets of internal constraint equations are used
to connect GA and GB to the shell grids GAi and GBi respectively. First, the
points GA and GB are connected to the auxiliary points GAHi and GBHi,
respectively. Second, the auxiliary points GAHi and GBHi are connected to
existing shell grids GAi and GBi, respectively.
5. For the formats ELEMID and GRIDID, the shell grids GAi and GBi are user
specified, either through shell element ids SHIDA and SHIDB or directly.
The end points GA and GB are connected to the shell grids GAi and GBi
regardless of the cross sectional area of the CWELD connector.
6. The parameters GSMOVE and NREDIA are used only for the formats
ELPAT and PARTPAT. If GSMOVE > 0 and the number of pairs of GAHi
and GBHi found is one, two, or three, then GS will be moved to a new
location following the rules listed below.

• If one pair of GAHi and GBHi is found, GS is moved to the middle
position between that pair and the original GS.

• If two pairs of GAHi and GBHi are found, GS is moved to the middle
position between those two pairs and the original GS.

• If three pairs of GAHi and GBHi are found, GS is moved closer to the

the second pair.
The search for pairs GAHi and GBHi resumes after GS is moved. This
process will be repeated until either four pairs of GAHi and GBHi are found
or the number of times GS is moved is equal to the value of GSMOVE. For
the latter case, the search diameter D to find GAHi and GBHi is cut in half if
NREDIA > 0 is specified. The iteration process repeats until a complete
projection is found or the number of times the diameter D is reduced is equal
to NREDIA.

may be entered using a combination of TABLEST and TABLES1 entries.
Each TABLES1 entry is at a constant temperature. All entries must be in the
form of stress vs. plastic strain using the stress and strain measures to be
incomporated into the analysis. All sets of stress-strain values for a
particular TABLES1 entry must be at the same temperature. One set is

11. The bending and twisting moments can be reduced to outer fiber stresses
and combined with membrane stresses in the composite plate elements. If,
in addition, the temperature is specified by the user at a point where outer
fiber stresses are calculated, the thermal expansion due to the difference
between the specified temperature and the temperature that would be
produced by a uniform gradient, T′ , is assumed to be completely restrained.
Stated differently, the second and higher order moments of the thermal
expansion are assumed to be completely restrained by elastic stiffness. The
resulting stress increment is
{ ∆σ } = – [ G e ] { α e } ( T – T o – T′z )
temperature at reference plane
where [ G e ] and { α e } are evaluated for the average temperature of the
element T .

3. If at least one nonzero or nonblank Tij is present, the point temperatures
given are used for stress recovery. If no Tij values are given, linear
temperature gradients are assumed for stress recovery. The Tij values are
not used in the calculation of differential stiffness.
4. If the second (and succeeding) continuation is present, EID1 and elements
specified on the second (and succeeding) continuations are used. Elements

EXCITEID will reference SPCD entries. If such entries indicate null
enforced motion, the program will then assume that the excitation is
enforced motion using large mass and will reference DAREA and
static and thermal load set entries just as in the case of applied load
excitation.

• There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
The program will reference SPCD entries specified by the LID field in
the selected LSEQ entries corresponding to the EXCITEID. If such
entries indicate null enforced motion, the program will then assume
that the excitation is enforced motion using large mass and will
reference static and thermal load set entries specified by the LID or
TID field in the selected LSEQ entries corresponding to the
EXCITEID, just as in the case of applied load excitation.
4. EXCITEID (field 3) may reference sets containing QHBDY, QBDYi, QVECT,
and QVOL and TEMPBC entries when using the heat transfer option.
5. If DELAY is blank or zero, τ will be zero.
6. TLOAD1 loads may be combined with TLOAD2 loads only by specification
on a DLOAD entry. That is, the SID on a TLOAD1 entry may not be the same
as that on a TLOAD2 entry.
7. SID must be unique for all TLOAD1, TLOAD2, RLOAD1, RLOAD2, and
ACSRCE entries.
8. If the heat transfer option is used, the referenced QVECT entry may also
contain references to functions of time, and therefore A may be a function of
time.
9. If TLOADi entries are selected in SOL 111 or 146 then a Fourier analysis is
used to transform the time-dependent loads on the TLOADi entries to the
frequency domain and them combine them with loads from RLOADi entries.
Then the analysis is performed as a frequency response analysis but the
solution and the output are converted to and printed in the time domain. In
this case, B will be rounded to the nearest integer. Please refer to “Fourier
Transform” on page 176 of the MSC.Nastran Advanced Dynamic Analysis
User’s Guide.
10. The USO field is used only when the dynamic excitation defined by the TYPE
field is enforced velocity or enforced acceleration using SPC/SPCD
specification. The initial displacements for the enforced degrees-of-freedom
in this case are given by the product { A } ( US0 ) where { A } is defined by the
EXCITEID field.

1. The TSTEPNL Bulk Data entry is selected by the Case Control command
TSTEPNL = ID. Each residual structure subcase requires a TSTEPNL entry
and either applied loads via TLOADi data or initial values from a previous
subcase. Multiple subcases are assumed to occur sequentially in time with
the initial values of time and displacement conditions of each subcase
defined by the end conditions of the previous subcase.
2. NDT is used to define the total duration for analysis, which is NDT * DT.
Since DT is adjusted during the analysis , the actual number of time steps, in
general, will not be equal to NDT). Also, DT is used only as an initial value
for the time increment.

TSTEPNL

2143

Parameters for Nonlinear Transient Analysis

3. For printing and plotting the solution, data recovery is performed at time
steps 0, NO, 2 * NO, ..., and the last converged step. The Case Control
command OTIME may also be used to control the output times.
4. The number of iterations for a time step is limited to MAXITER. If MAXITER
is negative, the analysis is terminated when the divergence condition is
encountered twice during the same time step or the solution diverges for five
consecutive time steps. If MAXITER is positive, the program computes the
best solution and continues the analysis until divergence occurs again. If the
solution does not converge in MAXITER iterations, the process is treated as
a divergent process. See Remark 6.
5. The convergence test flags (U = displacement error test, P = load equilibrium
error test, W = work error test) and the error tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and
EPSW) define the convergence criteria. All requested criteria (combination
of U, P, and/or W) are satisfied upon convergence. Note that at least two
iterations are necessary to check the displacement convergence criterion.
6. MAXDIV provides control over diverging solutions. Depending on the rate
of divergence, the number of diverging solutions (NDIV) is incremented by
1 or 2. The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV reaches MAXDIV
during the iteration. If the bisection option is used (allowed MAXBIS times)
the time step is bisected upon divergence. Otherwise, the solution for the
time step is repeated with a new stiffness based on the converged state at the
beginning of the time step. If NDIV reaches MAXDIV again within the same
time step, the analysis is terminated.
7. Nonzero values of MAXQN and MAXLS will activate the quasi-Newton
update and the line search process, respectively.
8. The number of subincrements in the material routines is determined such
that the subincrement size is approximately FSTRESS ⋅ σ . FSTRESS is also
used to establish a tolerance for error correction in elastoplastic material, i.e.,
error in yield function <FSTRESS ⋅ yield stress
If the limit is exceeded at the converging state, the program will terminate
with a fatal error message. Otherwise, the stress state is adjusted to the
current yield surface, resulting in δ = 0.

9. The bisection process is activated when divergence occurs and
MAXBIS ≠ 0. The number of bisections for a time increment is limited to
|MAXBIS|. If MAXBIS is positive and the solution does not converge after
MAXBIS bisections, the best solution is computed and the analysis is
continued to the next time step. If MAXBIS is negative and the solution does
not converge in |MAXBIS| bisection, the analysis is terminated.
10. ADJUST controls the automatic time stepping. Since the automatic time step
adjustment is based on the mode of response and not on the loading pattern,
it may be necessary to limit the adjustable step size when the period of the
forcing function is much shorter than the period of dominant response
frequency of the structure. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the
loading history is properly traced with the ADJUST option. The ADJUST
option should be suppressed for the duration of short pulse loading. If
unsure, start with a value for DT that is much smaller than the pulse duration
in order to properly represent the loading pattern.

• If ADJUST = 0, then the automatic adjustment is deactivated. This is
recommended when the loading consists of short duration pulses.

• If ADJUST > 0, the time increment is continually adjusted for the first
few steps until a good value of ∆t is obtained. After this initial
adjustment, the time increment is adjusted every ADJUST-th time
step only.

4C
X-Y PLOT

• If ADJUST is one order greater than NDT, then automatic adjustment

PARAM

CODES

is deactivated after the initial adjustment.
11. MSTEP and RB are used to adjust the time increment during analysis. The
recommended value of MSTEP for nearly linear problems is 20. A larger
value (e.g., 40) is required for highly nonlinear problems. By default, the
program automatically computes the value of MSTEP based on the changes
in the stiffness.
The time increment adjustment is based on the number of time steps desired
to capture the dominant frequency response accurately. The time increment
is adjusted as follows:

Under this condition no time step adjustment is performed in a structural

bisection strategy is based on the incremental rotation and controlled by
MAXBIS.

2. The imbalance load will be generated based on the mass value, offset values,
and the rotor spin speed.
3. If the entry is a real number, the value is considered constant. If the entry is
an integer number, the value references a table entry that specifies the value
as a function of time.
4. The cylindrical coordinate system used for the initial position of the mass
unbalance has the positive z-axis direction from GRIDA to GRIDB specified
on the RSPINT entry. Theta is measured from the plane defined by the z-axis
and the user specified vector (X1, X2, X3). Theta = 0.0 is in the direction of the
user-specified vector.
5. If the mass loss (increase) is relatively small, the correction may safely be
ignored (CFLAG = NONE). If CFLAG is set to MASS, SPEED, or BOTH; all
six degrees-of-freedom must be in the A-set.
6. PARAM,WTMASS will scale the mass value for load generation.
